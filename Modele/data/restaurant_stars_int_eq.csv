"We ordered corn cheese balls, manchow soup and paneer shashlik sizzler. The sizzler was stale. Paneer was smelling and the waiter was so impolite to even accept the mistake. Never going again",0
"Short review: Decent breads and starters, bad Shaam Savera, a little screwed up daal makhni (but should be a one-off case)
Better ambience at night... And importantly good quantity!
I wanted to give a 2.5 but that's not an option üôà
Extensive...
Ambience: It's better at night. Friends who had been here during the day didn't like it much. So if you prefer ambience, go at night!
Food! Ordered a Hara Bhara Kebab, Shaam Savera, Daal Makhni, rotis and raita (Yes! I'm a vegetarian üôà)
The good part! Quantity üòç
I was excited to see Shaam Savera on their menu. But take it from me, you do not want to order it. It is no where close to what it should be. They messed it up real bad, especially the colors.
The daal makhni had big chunks of garlic cloves which spoiled it for me. It wasn't creamy too :(
The breads and raita were decent!
The Hara Bhara Kebabs were decent too, soft! They had an extra outer coating of peanuts. So if you're not a peanut fan on your kebabs, ask them to skip that step üôà
Conclusion: It looked like they had made food in a hurry.
Would like to give this place another try hoping that mine was one of the odd cases. If things change, you'll know!",1
"The ambience was good, food was quite good . had Saturday lunch , which was cost effective .
Good place for a sate brunch. One can also chill with friends and or parents.
Waiter Soumen Das was really courteous and helpful.",2
"we went for a team lunch, such a worst restaurant.. food was tasteless, service was very slow and Ac was not working. We‚Äôve requested them multiple times but its of no use. Please don‚Äôt waste your money and I strictly recommend not to prefer beyond flavours,",0
The reason for giving only a 3 star is because of the longlong time wait for the tables. We went on Friday afternoon. We waited almost more than 30mins to get a table. We lost our patience and left for another restaurant as v didn't get a table even aftr waiting for such a long time.I think restaurant management should take this into consideration and try to decrease the waiting time of customer.,1
Ambience is too good for a pleasant evening. Service is very prompt. Food is good. Over all a good experience. Soumen Das - kudos to the service,2
"I have been at this place for dinner a few days back. The ambience was good. The restaurant was almost half occupied. We immediately got a table. But then waited for 10 mins to get water and menu, that too after a few reminders. We ordered a few starters, main course items and mock drinks. Only the starters could be served in 30 mins. There was no sign of mock drinks! We noticed similar service issues on other tables. Noticed guests literally shouting on the staff.

The food was just average. Dishes were not prepared well, at least when compared to 4.1 rating on Zomato.

We finally decided to just have starters, and hop onto another restaurant for rest of the meal!",0
"We went for lunch buffet yesterday and took a chance after seeing some good and some average reviews in Zomato.

The spread in buffet is too less, just 3 veg and 3 non veg starters, 2 main course in veg and non veg, just one fried rice and chicken Biryani.
Desserts are ice cream and jamun.

The taste was ok and not to expect too much. Little disappointing when starters are not hot.

Fish fry was decent, Schezwan chicken was ok.
Veg spring rolls were too good.
Big surprise for me is Onion rings as starters ü§£üòÇ

Kadai ghost in main course was good but missing that masala flavour.
Chicken was ok. Biryani is average, egg fried rice was good.

For the money we pay, we expect some good food. They use much of colour in food item's.

Suggestion to management is use less coating and less food colouring in starters.

Overall experience is ok, but they can be much better for the amount you pay.",1
A must try.. great food great ambience. Thnx for the service by Pradeep and Subroto. My personal recommendation is Penne Alfredo Pasta:) ....... Also the music in the background is amazing.,2
"I would like to introduce this restaurant to a new ingredient called salt. If you add that yo your food, it would taste way better. So basically none of the food we ordered had salt. We ordered Fries, panko mozzarella sticks, Tomato cream soup, panner65 & ""Italian"" Nachos. Not sure how that was nachos or italian. They basically bought a pack of dorittos and added mozarella cheese on top. The beans were not baked at all, and the entire dish was cold except for the plate that it was brought in. Pretty sure they just dumped the items and stashed it inside a microwave. The paneer 65 was horrendous. Might as well called it garlic 65 with no salt. Next was the mozarella sticks, which was again cold and no salt. The only decent item that we got was the fries and the soup. Thanks to gid we didnt order any main course. All these came up to 1300 and odd. Thanks to Zomato Gold, our price went down. This place is way too expensive for the quality of food they serve. And talking about the restaurant in general, the place looks decent but there are stoves stashed under tables and seats and plants kept at inconvenient spots. They really need to clean up more.",0
"We happened to go to this place on last sunday and it was mothers day and they had flat 50 on the buffet meal for the mother which i really liked..Needless to say the Ambience and music was really good .We had a reservation but had to wait fir 10 mins to get a seat..They served us mango juice as wrlcome drink which tasted really good.The buffet spread was one of a kind:
Strters : Veg : paneer tikka, veg spring roll and veg cutlet.They were lil cold but the taste wad good
Non veg : chicken kebab , chicken manchurian and fish .Fish was very tasty though it coupd taste better if it was hot.Chicken was fair enuf.
Singapore Noodles,Egg salad and pasta : They were good but it was cold.
Main course: mutton rogan josh, chicken tikka masala,palak paneer All were equally good
Biriyani: Egg frued rice and chicken biriyani were really great.
Desserts : moong dal halwa tasted really yumm, ice cream,gulab jamun,cut fruits,banana cake

The staff were too slow in service and the food was refilles very slow.We had to wait for quite long time to actually eat to stomach full.

They could improve the above points to stand better!
Overall :3.2",1
"Soumen das and Arun was a great guy. Only because of their behavior and sincerety, And good food off course, I would like to visit this place again.",2
"Hostile staff, okeish food, not so great ambiance. Not sure how the rating on zomato stands at 4.1
Starters we're decent but main course was horrible.
Will not suggest this place.",0
"I have been to this place twice and had 2 different experiences.
1st time it was with colleagues and I loved the food and ambience and service and everything except the prices as it was too costly. Their special baked biriyani is work a try, it's unique and tasty.
Because of the good experience I revisited this place with my sister. She orders a mocktail and it was terrible.they replace it but it was still not good. And then I asked them about a starter, if it was with bone or boneless and they told me it was boneless, later on the arrival they told me that it comes with both. It's disappointing to know that the staff doesn't know about the menu.",1
Food is good.we ordered Kodi drumsticks and basket mutton biryani. All are good. Thanks to Pradeep. He served well. We enjoyed here. Ambience is also very good.,2
Food quality and taste is not good. Super slow service. Nice ambience but very poor in customer handling. Lot of items not available even if in the menu.,0
Was there for office lunch outing. Rating would be mixed because food was fine but service was very bad. Booked table a day before but still had to wait for 30-40 mins to get one. Manager was polite but gave some rubbish reasons for bad service. Ambiance is fine.,1
"Ambiance is good, service is good, food is aPradeecp and subro best service
Food is good. Papiya good hostess and ur caption very good. This is 4star restaurant.",2
"This was my worst experience at a restaurant ever. First our starters were served after half an hour of ordering and the chicken popcorn had a hair strand in it yuck! Then the guy who took our main course order forgot about it completely so we had to order again after waiting for almost an hour. Then had to wait for another half hour to get our food. And the worst of all, they got us chicken lasagna instead of veg lasagna. We figured out that it was chicken right before one of my staunch vegetarian friend almost ate it. I do not recommend this place at all. There are so many better places in Gachibowli that could save your time and provide better service.",0
"Taste: there was huge hype about biryani hence I tried it, didn't find the taste up-to par, not really happy with the food taste.
Ambience: the place was well versed but not calming enough to keep you concentrated on food. The AC wasn't working properly which led to uneasy food experience.
Service: it was alright. Don't have much to talk about it!",1
"Its a very nice place, ambience is different, all the food we ordered was very tasty, service is also gud, worth visit. Its reasonable as well. Really a must visit place.",2
"Had a very bad experience here
beyond flavours really puts you beyond all the flavours
had gone here for dinner and the next day had to get hospitalised because of food infection
I guess the food was not served fresh",0
"I went to this place for lunch buffet by seeing the high ratings in zomato.

Good things first, the service is excellent! The waiters literally takes care of you when you are there.

Food: nothing great. As am more of a ""starter"" person , I love to have it in abundance but the starters were served on the table which ofcourse it's not served the way you like it. The sushi and Pani Puri were very okay-ish type
Main course was very normal, nothing extra ordinary. Taste of the food was very normal.
In dessert the red velvet cake and jalebi was good.

Service: it's very good and all the servers are trained very well.

Ambience: The place was jammed packed even for a Tuesday lunch. Couldn't enjoy that much as there was rush in front of every counter.

All in all a very okay-ish lunch!",1
Well after reading so many reviews finally visited this place...ambience was so good and coming to food crispy corn is nice. Tawa fish was ok... Basket Biryani disappointed us... biryani was ok but not flattering as they claimed.. Staff was polite and prompt especially pradeep and Suman.,2
I liked the food and ambience but the problem is with the staff.. they are not so responsive.. we‚Äôve ordered one item but we got something else.. otherwise place and the food are good..,0
"Heard about this restaurant from a friend and choose this place to have team lunch.

Rating

Ambiance: 4
Food :3
Service :4

There were many items on list but taste was not so good.

Don't be fooled by word unlimited beverages. only a single type of beverage is unlimited and you can't choose the flavour.

Totally felt disappointed by taste but customer service was good.",1
"Excellent food , specially if you like spicy food . Courteous staff . Shubro and pradeep and papiya gave excellent service to our corporate team dinner . Overall great for team dinners and party",2
It‚Äôs a worst service experience. Food was OK. They took 45mins to get veg pulav. Never seen a restaurant to take such time. Won‚Äôt visit again.,0
"Oh I had so much hope on this place looking at the descriptions and all, but this just turned out to be an imitator of ABs, may be with few concept changes here and there. Ok the food is fine and all but it's just the expectation of being different.",1
"Came for the birthday treat of a close friend. Perfect place for a treat like this. Very hospitable and cooperative staff. Food was delicious, ambience was really good with the music and the lighting. Chili honey lotus stem is a must try here. Special mention to Papiya who took good care of us.",2
Waiters are not good enough and you will get items which you have not ordered. Overall a bad experience. Waiting time is more than expected...,0
"No that good when compared to Tolichowki branch... Starters are good. But not the main course and Biryanis.
Tolichowki is the main branch for shah ghouse.",1
The service was great and the food was awesome. The service staff Manab and Papiya were very courteous and attentive. I would like to come frequently to this place,2
"Pathetic and horrible experience
Ambience and hospitality 1
Food 1
chairs and tables were broken food is cold and tasteless
Buffet arrangement is not good could be a bit more spacious",0
biryani was oily,1
"Very good ambience, amazing food ,good service and friendly staff - Pradeep, Papiya and Shuvro :) will definitely visit again! And loved the design of their menu card.",2
"I have ordered 2 special chicken biryani's and received two ordinary biryani's with bones! This is a big time disappointment. This place was known for its Biryani and now I feel like I have had a worst biryani.

It costed 400 bucks each and receiving the same 200 bucks biryani has been my worst experience.",0
"In regular days, its a good place to have a good Biryani. But during Ramzan, the quality of food goes down in terms of taste. But Haleem is always good here.",1
Food was very good. Soup was as expected. In starters we ordered honey chilli lotus stem and that is a must try for vegan ppl. Service was great. Frequent visits from Papiya to know our experience and also about the food was really impressive.,2
"Very bad dine in experience I had with this restaurant. We booked this place for office lunch with some instructions, but none of them met by the restaurant. Overall very bad experience",0
Ordered special chicken biryani. Biryani was great in taste but ambience was not good. Also this restaurant is too unhygienic and over crowded.,1
Food is too good. Telangana kodiak fry is must try.Mutton biriyani is too good.Papiya helped to choose best dishes and attended very well.Must visit.,2
"Mumbaikars have heard about the famous paradise restaurant... Hence decided to try out this one with great hope.
Ambience at this place is great; however i was not really impressed with the food and service.

We ordered :
Chilli chicken : 2.5/ 5
Paneer tikka : 3.5/5
Chicken masala : 0.1/5 ... lowest rating possible
Chicken biryani: 3/5
Garlic naan: 2/5

The staff were least bothered and kept us waiting for like 20 mins jus to take order and after all that the food was very disappointing. This is only a much hyped restaurant. I would not go and recommend this place to anyone for frequent dine experience.",0
Shwarma was really good. Biryani was average with hard huge chicken pieces. Paneer dish was also average. They have seating for everyone from bachelors to family.,1
Food and ambience is fantastic.. Waiter Manav Maji was really quick in his service.. Cheese Balls is a must try starter as it was very scrumptious,2
We were 4 people who visited this place on Thursday night....Ambience and service are good .Food is disappointed.Not worth for money we pay.,0
"Me and my friends has a mandi at Shah Ghouse restaurant which was at Gachibowli, and our experience was really poor comparing to others restaurants in Hyderabad.",1
"Came here for lunch and the food was good and tasty. We tried buffet and all the items in veg and non-veg were tasty.

The ambience and service were also good, and the staff were courteous.

"Hi
This time, we are not satisfied in flechazo.. Starters are not much hot.. most of them are room temparature or little warm.. we have asked for fish starter.. we got only two pieces.. bbq wings are not good.. tooo hard... mango chilli prawns not much tasty... only maida coating smell.. no flavour nothing... we are not happy with flechazo, gachibowli...",0
Food taste better here. The food servicing is not that much good. The food preparation time is bit high. If you have patience to wait then you can give a try for it.,1
The best thing about this place is the food. My favorite go to dish here is definitely Alfredo Pasta although other items are good as well. And the service and behavior of the staff is top-notch. We we're attended by Mr. Soumen Das and he was extremely polite. Will definitely visit soon.,2
"I‚Äôm not going to this place again. Though the ambiance is good, Flechazo Gachibowli deeply lacks a sense of hygiene. We went there as a family. The first thing that caught our attention was the extremely sticky floor. The chefs at the live counters very well display the hygiene standards of this place. You find them standing idle meddling with the ingredients, scratching their heads and using their gloved hands to handle everything around. Another unique practice I noticed was that, while the waiter serves you the starters, he is constantly touching the serving spoons/tongs to the half eaten food in your plate. Then you find him serving the same starters to the next table.
The place is chaotic, with open dried up ingredients and food kept at most counters. The main course buffet has limited choices too.
But for the well thought of ambience, there is nothing positive I could write about this place.",0
Ordered Regular Chicken Biryani but the rice was not cooked and the i ordered double masala which i didn't get and the taste was not that good which was great when i ordered before.,1
Polite and friendly staff. Nice ambience and good spread of menu. Drinks are awesome. Service is very good by manav... looking forward to seeing it again...,2
It is seldom you see a restaurant with 4.9 rating. My friend and I had come with great expectations. But the restaurant didn't manage to live up to any of it. Even the 2 rating is because the staff was very polite and we had no complains there. Coming to the food: the sushi isn't good. The chef isn't aware that you don't give mayonnaise on sushi but wasabi. The starters were okay and we didn't repeat anything. In spite of being non vegetarians the only item we liked was the crispy corn. Then in aglio olio they used macaroni. The main course had a terrible array of dishes. And none was good. The biriyani had no chicken. The couscous salad had just quinoa and olives. The chocolate ice cream had an overdose of milk. All in all a very forgettable experience. However to reiterate the staff was good and after we politely told him about our experience he insisted on providing something special.,0
Taste is good but the service at gachibowli was really poor which compelled the guests to look for another option despite wanting to stay. ..,1
"Food is really good. We had vegetarian items including paneer, mushroom and kofta. Additionally service from Papiya , Shuvro was really good.",2
"Apart from the starters; the main course, dessert, the wonky table we sat on was just a big disappointment. The ice cream was made with just cream and chocolate sauce with dry ice and that is not good.",0
I have ordered Egg fried rice and some roties from here at night 11'o clock. The food was ok-ish. I don't know if I ordered in time. Roties were also not that much good.,1
"Beautiful, cozy and classy at the same time, this place is truly recommended for your special days. With 15 percent corporate discounts, you can treat your cotorie well without burning a hole ur pocket. Also, the interior is done so well, you ll love the vibe. On the menu, honey chilli lotus stems, basket biryanis, sizzling brownies were my favourite. Also loved the tomato basil shorba, different from the creamy standards in other restaurants. I'm definitely making more visits to Beyond Flavours. Special mention to Papiya, our hostess for the evening, excellent service :)",2
"Liked the food it's was good but not anything special or memorable, good service but I do not appreciate how the waiters pestered me into writing a review. No wonder this place a high rating staff will keep bugging you till you write a good review",0
Ordered chicken briyani and vegetables briyani. It's was good as usual!! If they could increase the paneer in the veg briyani that would be brilliant.,1
"please was good but it was quite expensive and coming to taste we can rate 3 out of 5, we cant click better pictures wen we visit in nightü§£ü§≠best in day time for pics",2
"Food is good, but for the second time around they didn't send us our complete order. Had ordered 4 Naans, got only 2. Also got Daal Tadka instead of Daal Makhani. Not sure if its the Ramadaan rush, but now twice in a row our online orders thru Zomato have been messed up. Probably will avoid going forward.",0
"Food is decent and tastes palatable, not the best, though not very comfortable with the hygiene. Ambience is average, service is poor. Good value for money if one can ignore the ambience and service.",1
Service was too good and fast. Even these people were so polite and well behaving. Manav and pradeep you were good. Hope everyone behaves the same way,2
"Its a worst thing happened with me.we ordered for mutton family pack.here i got chicken familypacküôÑi dont know who's neglegance is this..either restaurant person or delivery boy...i made a call to restaurent to know what's the problem is,but they are not responding at all..please check when you asked for food delivery....",0
"This place was on my Hyderabad bucket list for a long time. The ambience was awesome to top that it was IPL 2019 final. The live dj was great. Coming to the food we ordered a pitcher of Belgian brewed üç∫ (warning it's a jug rather than a pitcher) but that's the best beer I ever had. The beer was accompanied by chicken 65 and pepperoni and lamb pizza. Both of them were outstanding.
The worst part was the service the place is short on staff. One waiter was waiting 7 tables and he constantly kept on ignoring us as we were the last table.",1
"We had our farewell feast here recently enjoyed very well very good management so does the boys who gave complimentary food and made us more happy
Food was perfect desserts, starters was wonderful",2
"I have placed order for Mutton Haleem Special - 3 Qty and Biryani Rice - 1 Qty. Shah Ghouse and Zomoto together delivered shortage of Mutton Haleem Special - 1 Qty, informed to deliver executive while collecting parcel and reportes to Zomoto support. Zomoto team said that no response from Shah Ghouse regarding shortage delivery. Finall Zomoto also not confirmed anything and accepted refund only missed item value. Packing also very unhygienic. Totally upset with Shah Ghouse and Zomoto.",0
"Over the moon... Name is not matching with ambience. There is no roof top seating for this brewery. Outside seating was just average, atleast the same ambience can be in the second are third floor. Service was very quick and fast. Because there is no other brewery in surroundings we can visit to this place.",1
"Excellent experience, mouthwatering food, good ambience, a must go place in hyderabad. We were served by Shubhro and Papiya. They were awesome in their behaviour. Had an enjoyable evening with friends.",2
"I heard Haleem will be so good, etc etc but taste is not that great as others said. Just boiled the meat and grinded like paste. Nothing special in it",0
"I was really excited about this place as I have heard great reviews about the food .So i went there with a friend to try out .
Ambience: Its beautiful and so lovely and happening .
Food : We ordered irani chicken tikka and a mexican pizza .The chicken tikka was a lil undercooked and also it was bland .
Dint like at all . The pizza was good and loaded with cheese and veggies.
Service : Its bad - really bad .. Might be the only reason i would not want to go again .
There are some great reviews about this place - but my experience was not nice at all. So dissapointed
+1 is for the ambience",1
The place is very good.. 5* to the live music.. She is just superb with beautiful voice.. Food is nice n loved the lightning..üòçentrance is also very nice..,2
"Ordered kaju panner, they have delivered chicken curry. So disappointed. Enquired with Zomato delivery boy he says we just pick the item and come.",0
"Been to OTMBC basing on friends suggestion.Keep reminded that stags r not allowed to ground floor may be on weekends. Disappointing but we made our minds to get onto first floor, gracious ambience,nice music and courteous staff. Multiple options to try from their Brewery and food was ok. Recommended place for hangouts with friends...",1
"Sonalin has a great voice.. üòç must visit the place once.. became fan of her. The food is good.. 5 star from my side. Live music, lightening everything is just awesome üòç",2
I ordered mutton biryani for lunch today. The mutton was not cooked properly. It was hard and unchewable. I had high expectations from this restaurant as I had heard good feedback from a friend. I was really dissapointed.,0
"The place and ambience was good.Only sour point was our waiter Kundan who told us to change places as soon as we were seated (maybe to accommodate his regular guests who tip him well).I had Zomato gold membership and showed him the same.Instead of taking a photo of the same,he started surfing the phone. When I objected,he denied checking the phone. Though the food and place was good,the waiter spoiled the mood just with his creepy attitude, which cost the two stars.",1
I heard her voice..she is too beautiful with amazing voice ..just love her voice the way she sings üòç became fan of Sonalin Priyadarshini. Good place must visit. The food is also nice..,2
They send me wrong order I ordered mutton biryani and they send me chicken biryani and this app is worst app we can't even get in touch with customer care.,0
"Went here to catch up with a friend, very near the ORR entrance and right beside the main road. The interior was well done with the brewing machine at display which was the centre of attraction for most people visiting there. The seating was plush and comfortable. The choice of food was aplenty and the service was very prompt and homely. The preparation and plating everything was about perfect, but we did not liked the Lemon soda, it had some weird taste. In all it was good.",1
Sonalin is a very good singer in the city.. beautiful face with beautiful face must visit this place .. Beautiful live music.. loved it.. üòç loved the food as well. Very good lightning.,2
"I have ordered multiple times from this restaurant and I have never been so upset. Of course I have recieved wrong orders from this place once or twice before which I ignored and not reported thinking these might be human errors but its beyond those now. Orders can't go wrong so many times when you have such a full fledged food business across the city. Yet another incident today where my order was wrong. You can check with my name what I ordered and find the attached picture of what you sent in my very recent order which was on 7th May'19.

Hope you people learn from your mistakes and yes I wouls also like to bring it to notice that the zomato support is no good either. They deny support right on your face which is unprofessional and unethical both at the same time. Guess Zomato needs to upgrade their standards and teach their support reps about what customer service is about and how to do it right.",0
Overpriced! Coming to the weekends they doesn't make the food tasty! Fish was not good there is no flavor at all I the food . And 3* only for the ambience,1
"Food is descent enough. Desert options were also good
Starrers were also tasty.
One bad experience ee had is waiting time even though we booked table prior time.",2
"When you will order ,you will get other item ..surprising restaurant..wheather you order chiken you will always get veg cheap cost item. Better to don't order food my suggestion ..because I ordered more then twice got less cost cheap unordered item ..save money",0
"#6packfoodie goes The Fisherman's Wharf!

Food:5/5 (why 3/5 in the main review then??)
Ambience: 5/5
Courtesy and staff: 1/5
Zomato gold experience: 1/5

When we reserve table, we expect to get the seat preference. I booked the table for 2 with seat preference as Outdoor seating. The issue was the lady who was attending us directly said that you've booked indoor seating, when i did show the details about my booking then she said ""Outdoor seating cannot be reserved"". If this is the case can you guys please update the same in your page. Disappointed.

Finally after the discussion, we decided to sit on the upper floor with a good view, since Outdoor seating cannot be reserved even with the prior booking. Moving on lets go to food.

Ambience: The entire olace has goan vibe to it. The area is huge and there is a lot space between tables. The sections are divided into shack like structures named after the beaches in Goa.

Drinks: LIIT, one of the best LIITs I had in Hyderabad. The lime mint juice was also tasty.

Food: Ordered beef chilly fry. The tenderness of the meat was perfect. Spice level, presentation was worth the price. They have ""as per size"" menu for their specialities such as lobsters, prawns, Pomfret. We had chose the butter garlic tiger prawns. Again, the presentation and the taste was class apart. The spice balance was fantastic.

Now comes the worst zomato gold experience.

Before ordering as you woukd expect, i unlocked my zomato gold, which means the lowest priced dish is complimentary (beef chilly fry in my case, since it was lower priced among the two).

The guy who served us didn't come with the bill. Another guy came up, saying we cannot give you the lower priced dish as complementary, because ""as per size"" menu is not included in the zomato gold. Which means you have to pay for everything!!!

This was never mentioned anywhere, neither it was informed to us by the guy who served us amd later camouflaged somewhere.

We had to pay for the entire bill, irrespective of the zomato gold because of unawareness of the staff.

Later ordered one more dish as a take away, which was made complementary.

If potion size and value for money is what you're looking for then this olace is not for you. If you're a sea food lover and want goan ambience in Hyderabad, then thumbs up.

Peace‚úåüèª",1
"Excellent food and very good service by soumen das..
Ambience was good too with live music. Food was served timely. Decor of the restaurant was amazing as well.",2
The waiters were very rude that the hotel is very busy...if you ask for starters and soups they say it will late order biryaniü§®ü§®...Inam shocked with their behaviour with customers,0
This place has good ambiance but i had a weird experience with food. The menu drums of heaven mentioned chicken wings but we were served drumsticks instead. Upon enquiring the respective guy tried to convince us the drum sticks are drums of heaven. When we had to show him menu and explained the difference for crying out loud he said there is a mistake in menu and went. Next u guys be the judge.,1
My review for this place would be 5star for the ambeince and the service from the staff which lacks in lot's of place even though the food is good in places like these. Special hey to papiya shuvro!,2
"The contact number in the true caller shows best cheaters in the world... Good
I had ordered for mutton biryani nd I got noodles which are ugly... Wow I am so happy for that
Good keep it up(bullshit)
How careless they are for delivering this type of service to customer who orders for food
This is really disgusting and bullshit
I suggest everyone not to order any food from this restaurant(Shah ghouse gachibowli)
Better remove service from zomato
Many of our friends had many issues from this restaurant, like delivering different food from ordered food, and delivering one shawarma instead of two and others
Zomato authority should take of all these problems which are spoiling the name and fame",0
"Situated at end of the city. Very Spacious and Ambience makes us feel like it was in Goa ! Theme restaurant like a fisherman's place ! Number of sea food items available! We can select a fish and make them prepare in customisation way ! We visited for a friend's party , ordered many items but we are not satisfied with the taste ! Soup tasted so bad ! Prawns and Fish items are not so much tasty ! Potato Starter was good ! Squats in fish was good ! Ordered Lemonade but not much great than I tasted before !",1
"It was a very nice experience. Food was amazing. Friendly staff, with welcoming attitude. Papia was very friendly and accommodating. Good ambiance. I will definitely recommend this place.",2
"I ordered an egg biriyani and got a chicken piece in it, disgusting! Never ever going to order from this restaurant again. Disappointed.....",0
"Visited this place on Saturday evening.
Had stuffed crab , fish starter, chicken in goan style ( was very spicy),stuffed chicken.

In drinks we had bull frog, drink was strong and tasted good

We went to have sea food here, only one crab was available that is very big one .

Ambience is nice. I didn't liked the food much.
This place is very expensive also.

Overall not very happening place",1
"Had dinner with my friends. Menu is perfect, something for everyone. Service was awesome and Papia was very accommodating. Good ambience with amazing live music. Will be back definitely!",2

I had ordered gobi methi paratha.. it was ok. Not good. It was too oily. Not much taste. It tasted like it was a re-heated paratha. Not fresh.,1
Service experience was very good especially by Papiya. Food served was very good and tasty and they served it very well. I would like to visit Beyond again and will recommend it to friends for its food and its reasonable price.,2
"Ordered veg biryani here, the vegetables they used especially beans are awful. The are almost became like drumstick on chewing and cant eat them. Will never order again neither recommend to any.",0
Food was good but it was all leaking from the plate. And so quantity was very less as compared and i expected rice as well with the thali but it was missing,1
"Service , Food and Ambiance was very nice. Staff was very humble while taking order and while serving food. Live music was like cherry on the cake",2
"Worst food, no quality this would be the worst biryani I ever i had in my entire life. This the chicken biryani without chicken and the chicken is mashed up and keema and I would say this is chicken keema biryani ü§£ü§£ü§£.",0
"Intially, yes,the food was really good they were maintaining quality standard of food very well,which is rare in Indian restaurant nowadays I don't see that happening these.Today I have found hair my fit thali,which shows how much hygienic they are ,apart from this so many times I have seen they miss on cutlery or few items. I mostly order fit thali so I know very well what it consist of not just one time so many time items are missing.",1
The food was ‚ù§Ô∏è.. We ordered banjara tangdi for starter which was the best among all.. Papiya Shuvro was well mannered and her service was best among all.,2
"We ordered egg biryani and we were delivered chicken biryani with chicken replaced with eggs. He tried his best to pose it as egg and biryani but he forgot to remove bones from the biryani.

Wouldn't order egg biryani from here again.",0
I ordered dal makhani with paratha . The parathas were good so soft and tasty .Dal makhani was ok.It was tasting some different but it was good .üòä,1
Staff are just polite and responsive. Food is the best part here. And it is better as ambience also awesome here. I met two persons here named Papiya and Shuvro who are the best at their services. Food items i liked here were Basket biryani and Kodi drum sticks. Finally just loved.,2
"Ordered sechwan rice from here, the rice was not cooked properly and it was too dry and hard to eat with full off oil. I haven‚Äôt expected such food from this restaurant. They should have eaten the food first before it is sending out for delivery.",0
"For the first time tried the light lunch meal from Eat.fit which has 450Kcal (as mentioned).

Decent packaging with eco friendly cutlery though not happy with the plastic box. Chicken chettinad was average as chicken could be softer and cabbage sabji seemed overlooked with excess of oil. Chapatis were homely, soft and warm something a bit hard to get in Hyderabad. A less sweet ladoo was complimentary though some salad would have been better to make it healthier. Not sure if I would order this again, but could maybe try their salads.",1
"I came here with my parents. We ordered for Thai peneer tikka, kaju pulao and veg biryani. The kaju pulao and veg biryani were really good. This is a decent place to go with family. Shubro and papiya served well.",2
"Very very bad experience for me, the waiter servicing was very bad I really irritated a lot by this environment , very bad feeling to me I requested u please improve customer servicing l, they not even response us I should call 5 more times I really feeling very bad, for me first time such a bad experience to meüòë",0
Forgot to give spoon and tissues,1
Well we‚Äôre new to Hyderabad . And I can for a fact say that it‚Äôs probably the best place I‚Äôve eaten a buffet at in Hyderabad period . Especially id like to thank Shurvo and Papiya for their amazing service . Double metha was just too good . Overall a worthwhile experience,2
"This is bloody disgusting. I had to wait for more than 120 mins for my order. And after that got a call for cancellation of the order. If you can't sever the order let the customer know about it, don't made him wait for a long time. 120 mins of Sunday is precious for me. To hell with your service...",0
"We ordered 1 Luckhnowi chicken biryani for 130 rupees. The taste was okay. Strong smell and taste of rose water spoiled the overall experience of having biryani. But I haven't had Lucknow biryani before, so can't really judge how it exactly supposed to taste.",1
"Wonderful place with awesome ambience, best to visit at night to see all the pretty lights and to enjoy some savory foods. Shubro and Papiya were good with service.",2
"I visited this place with my brother after reading some great reviews and ratings on Zomato. Though the restaurant claims to be authentic original Hyderabadi taste the Gachibowli branch was open in 2015. Given that the ambiance and maintenance is pathetic. It looks and feel extremely unhygienic to the point that we had second thoughts eating there. Staff was extremely disorganized and there were many customers seen complaining.
So for ambiance and hygiene it's a complete NO...
Food was okay we ordered Apollo fish starter which was very hard. And spcl mutton biryani which was good but nothing exceptional and Paradise or Pista house has better taste than it. Quantity wise it was sufficient for both of us. And it was pocket friendly hence 2 ratings.
I would not be visiting or suggesting this place to anyone.",0
"Ordered the breakfast combo from zomato. The taste was good and simple. Feels just like home made food and healthy too. The breakfast combo had a bread/bun, omelette, grilled tomato and side(curry kinda ) for the bun.",1
"Good ambience and great service.We've had buffet for 25 people.The waiters were patient and we even got noodles replaced since the one served in the buffet went bad.
Shoutout to Shubro and Pradeep ,took care of our entire Afternoon.",2
I ordered chicken biryani online.. Zomato delivered it ontime but food quality was very bad.. Honestly I doubt whether they are serving chicken or some other meat.. I had to thrown the biryani that they delivered.. Very bad restaurant that I felt.,0
"A 3.5‚≠êÔ∏è

Well the packaging is surely good along with those nice quality tiny miny boxes and their concept is kinda interesting regarding the calories and stuff for the complete diet freaks.

So i was not sure if i would like their items so just went ahead and ordered one of their Chicken Keem Paratha Wrap. Its was oily and tasted ok, not bad at all. It tasted just  like a regular keema wrap bus.

Yes it came with sugar/ honey coated peanuts and some green chutney, am not sure how it makes up the diet fit. But yes, a nice concept though!",1
"My review of the place comes after multiple visits, that have spanned over 4 months. And now I can safely say that it's one of the good places around.
They're located near the Biodiversity signal, above Fabindia. There's ample parking for both two and four wheelers. The ambience is a bit dim after dark, and the seating is divided into various options, including a PDR section.
The menu design is in the shape of a bottle, and the array spans Continental, Chinese and Indian cuisines. Here's the list of things that I have tried, across all my visits

Panko Crumbed Mozzarella Sticks ‚ù§Ô∏è - Cheese sticks that are coated and fried. Pure cheese bliss.
Veg Lasagna ‚ù§Ô∏è - This place has one of the good Lasagne in the town.
Crispy Chilli Corn Kernels - The usual favourite, this one has a slightly different presentation here.
Makhmali Paneer Tikka -
Cottage Cheese Shashlik Sizzler
Italian Nachos - Nachos topped with red sauce and cheese, and baked in the dish.
Cheese and Cheese Pizza ‚ù§Ô∏è - Soft base pizza, loaded with cheese, and a few pieces of green olives.

I cannot stress enough on how I have loved all that I tried here. I have also tried out their lunch buffet. The variety may not be as elaborate as other places, but with the food quality and the discount that they offer for bulk bookings, it is at least a one-time try. But what I really adore here is their mocktails. Beyond Delight is an absolute delight! Also a fan of the Guava and Chilli, and Apple and Kiwi Night drinks.

The staff is ever so courteous. A special mention to Papiya and Shuvro, who were our attendants on the latest visit. The place has Zomato Gold 1+1, which further brings down their reasonable rates. A meal for two would roughly be around 700, that fills not only your tummy, but also you heart!",2
not good,0
quantity too less for a meal,1
Had lunch today at beyond flavors .The food was very Good and delicious and awesome service was provided by Soumen Das & Shuvro. Would highly recommend the restaurant .,2
"Worst food received, low quality rice was used, egg fried rice was almost spoiler, unable to eat. Worst experience ever, does not recommend.",0
"Dates tea cake was good. I was expecting it to be gooey considering the nature of dates or some layer in between concentrating on dates. It was plain regular cake with flax seed topping making it healthier.
Topped with chia seeds, the Lemon tea cake was surprising as I could feel cinnamon. It was slightly oily. At first it was tasteless but then it turned out to be tastier than dates tea cake.
These cakes are Wheat based just as described which is a good thing.Though the quantity seemed decent for the price for both cakes, I wish it could've been more just as shown in cult fit website.",1
"Service is really exceptional. Cheers to Manav, who served us really well. Food was nice too. Loved the ambience too, with nice music playing in the background.",2
The ordered veg biryani was without vegetables..I don't understand how this is called a veg biryani..the quantity is good matching to the cost.,0
chicken was good..mix veg is very sweet..and small roties..,1
"Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!
Soumen Das waited our table! Thanks buddy for a great service. Will visit soon!",2
"Ordered food via swiggy and got old and rubbery chicken. Of course it was stale and leftover stuff which was remodeled and resold. Shameful conduct,never ordering again.",0
I had ordered chilly chicken Hakka noodles. It taste good. Chicken pieces are well seasoned and juicy. Iam impressed with the presentation. Taste would have much better. It not taste like real Chinese cuisine. But I recommend to try atleast once,1
Papiya Shuvro was great. She helped us get the tables quickly and suggested us the best sizzlers in the menu. Ambience was awesome. She suggested the best table and was very helpful till we were there. Will visit again for the awesome service. You guys should try as well if u plan to take your loved one n give an osm experience then this is the place.,2
"The food was really bad. Onion Salad was not served. Worst taste. Rahtha and the fish ordered smelled very bad, I was completely disappointed with Shah Ghouse biryani",0
not tasty,1
"Quite good ambience,liked special restro biryani,must try,like the service Papiya and shuvro,they were really good at der service.will like to visit again.Its nice place to visit specially at nyt tym.food was yum.Should try biryani.",2
Shah Ghouse Hotel Did not deliver my order after making payment online. Zomato to ensure my online payment to be refunded as early as possible.,0
"Dear eat.fit , what on Earth charging you 180/- ? For this 3 rotis, 2 spoons of veg curry, enough dal and little salad with spoon of raita
I am surprised why you guys are charging this much in the name of fitness.

3 star is for taste and quality. But quantity doesn't even meet expectations.
Very poor",1
Pradeep and shubroto were amazing and friendly. Service was awesome n food out of the world.must visit for all people out there. Will visit again,2
"Please don't visit this place in the night if at all you are going along with your family...
No service after 12:00 as the zomato says it's open upto 2:00...complete missguiding and fooling customers....
I'm a fan of the biryani served here...but the staff,the timings,and the cleanliness over here is a clean bullshit...
Better to visit the other branches like shalibanda and tolichowli...please don't visit this holy hell....!
I posted some pics just look at the table where we dine to eat...yuck...!",0
"Had tried Chicken Shawarma, Lukmi, Samosa, Veg Puff, Egg and Chicken Puff.
Chicken Shawarma, was expecting the taste to be lot better but it was just ok. It tasted bland and mayonnaise was also not upto to the mark. Overall Didn't meet my expectations.

Both Lukmi and samosa were same in taste and preparation, just the shape was different. Better to go for samosa instead of Lukmi, the taste was ok though.

Comming to the Puffs, all were pretty average just like you would get in any other random bakery. Not a big fan of these.",1
We visited this place for a colleagues farewell. We had a really great time.Good food and service by Pradeep and Shobro. Will come again later,2
I have ordered through Zomato 1 chicken and 1 Veg biryani and received Chicken and Egg biryani.  This is second instance happened.  I have thrown away the Egg biryani and also the taste of the Chicken biryani is not so good.....,0
"Authentic biriyani. Must try the platters. Its an old and good brand. The service is not up to the mark given their confidence that people will come no matter how they treat customers. The food will cool you down even if their behavior is not good. Overall, okay experience.",1
"The restaurant has an amazing ambience. Staff is polite and suggest good recommendations on food. If you visit Beyond Flavours sometime, do reach out to Papiya and Shuvro as she can suggest some really good dishes.",2
"Most disappointing experience ever! Ordered for vegetable biryani during midnight hours from this restaurant. Delivery through swiggy was quick and swift but to my surprise I received only biryani rice, absolute no vegetables or masala. Very bland taste too. I do not understand why these restaurants cheats customers if they out of stock. I would not recommend anyone to trust this restaurant",0
Not a great one and not a bad one either. Can try it once. The packaging isnt great and it spill off easily. Give a try but dont expect too much.,1
Excellent food and service. Special mention for Papiya Shuvro. Surprised to see such good quality food being served at such low prices. Ambience is quite good too. Highly recommended.,2
Horrible biryani this is what we got when we ordered on Swiggy. It looks like you just want to make money selling biryani and left over pieces,0
Over sausage in the shawrma roll,1
Papiya and Shuvro as the f&b executives were really courteous and friendly. Thoroughly enjoyed our experience here. Good place for a cute Lil date hehe and for a nice family dinner.,2
"I had heard a lot about this place so I went there. The dining area was pretty jammed and there seemed a lot of dirt lying around like used napkins, food etc. I anyway passed it for the fact that the place is all time busy. But then I saw a RAT nibbling on the scattered food. I reported this to the manager and he told me it's okay and 'ek do Galti toh ho jati hai' and they literally forced me to pay for my order which I did not even touch. The staff was highly rude and it has been one of the worst experiences in Hyderabad.",0
Reduced the quantity from before. I hope they get back to the old times,1
"This was the first time we visited this restaurant and the experience was good in terms of food, hospitality, service and ambience. Thanks to shubro and papiya for their hospitality",2
"The hotel never updates the status of the order. I called Zomato support after 20 mins of placing the order, then the Zomato support team calls the hotel to accept the order and then they update the order. Next them mention it will be delivered by 1:11pm but again no update. I called again at 1:15pm to check what happened to the order. They again called the hotel to get an update. Then they mention your food is still getting prepared, its in the kitchen. What the hell the order that should have delivered way back its still in kitchen and you guys don't mind to update or apologize. I asked to cancel the order and Zomato said it can't cancel as it will be waste of food. Great and I am stuck with the hotel's will to deliver it or not. Pathetic service.",0
"Rating 3.5/5
Although very little resemblance with the Lebanese shawarma wrap, the Rumali roti shawarma tasted good. The wrap has good quantity of chicken stuffings and the sauce was good too. But once again, the chicken was quite spicy. So if you are looking for healthy food, this shawarma isn't your call. Very fast delivery.",1
The place is just beyond beautiful. Ambience is excellent and food is good. The service by Soumen Das is extremely good. Highly recommended place.,2
my chicken was not boneless,0
late delivery,1
"I have been to beyond a few times and have tried out a lot of their dishes, it never disappoints.
I would specially recommend their soups, the healthy broth soup and the roasted chicken soup are amazing.
In addition the service is great and our server Papiya was very courteous and prompt. This place has become my go to place for a good dining experience.",2
"I have ordered for special mutton biryani but they delivered chicken biryani

And no response form the restaurant num of the number were working",0
"Chicken shawarma is awesome.. but ordered veg falafel too, with instructions not to put cucumber(kheera) because I am allergic to cucumber.. but have ignored it n made me fall sick... Also,I mentioned extra mayoneese which wasn't there!

5 ratings for special chicken shawarma
1rating for veg falafel.",1
If you have time to waste for taste u r most welcome ... the taste was really superb but the service was very very slow..! Dishes were impressively having different flavours which i liked..!,2
Food was bad. Ambience was average. I am not sure why this place is so over hyped. No way its rating should be 4.6. Will never go back to this place.,0
"One line #Only4chicken üòú, Ambience is good with large screen inside and nice atmosphere outside. Coming to food you will not find any item other than Chicken for Non veg and Aloo for Veg üòÇ. Service is very poor I hardly see two people serving and cleaning. Can give a try only once with friends by going for early bird Buffet.",1
The food here is good and would add on if you could increase your spread.Ananya was courteous and good at serving..!!Ambience was also good and was peaceful...........................!!!!!!!!!!‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è,2
The managers are so rude to the customers. Twice they declined the entry on two consecutive days. We came here looking at the reviews but the behavior of the staff killed the mood. They seemed bias towards the guests and prefer people whom they know at the entry.,0
"I and my friend went here to watch the IPL live screening and have some good time. One good thing was that they have 2+2 on drinks through Zomato gold. The food pretty decent too, but what I didn't like was that it didn't have good options in drinks, especially non-alcoholic. We eventually went for Masala coke as our second drink it turned out pretty bad. We asked them to exchange for another drink but they wouldn't take it back. Wasn't happy with the service.

Also the live music there wasn't great.",1
"Pardeep and shubrat has served great food and great ambience. Must try !!!

The food is awesome and ambience is too good. A great place to go with a team",2
"I must say the higly overrated place....There is very bad service from the team .No one os really help to underatand the manu ..I really struglled to.understand for Veg and NonVeh items. Similary for mocktails there is no.proper details.

Not worth for money. 1star from my side",0
They have worst north indian food i believe. Spoiled my birthday mood since i am punjabi and ordered north indian food. But other than that chinese and continental was good. Their safe sex on beach deink is great just.,1
"One of the best restaurants in Hyderabad near Gachibowli.. ambiance was good.. Lunch spread was good and was very tasty.
Thank Papiya for her guidance.",2
"Very slow service, food was very cold and tasteless. Tables were not cleaned properly.
Not worth going again. Although ice tea was decent enough.",0
One place to order pasta when you‚Äôre hungry in office also stomach filling with two toasted breads if your hungry want to order something quickly without scrolling down much just order it and wiat for the food,1
I really liked the food here it was different from what we get in every other restaurant ..really appreciate the service by Papiya..loved the presentation of the food..,2
"I have always loved this place but my recent experience was horrible. Even after booking the table well before time , they gave me a table on 1 st floor with all stags around me . The worst part was that it was a friday where they say they allow stag entries. The service was equally poor.",0
Menu needs a major overhaul. Not for a large group of people. Not for everyone due to limited items in menu. Mocktails are damn expensive. Ambience not as good as few competitors.,1
Had a good food and good time at this place.. Ambience was really good and had a nice time... Thanks @shubro for assistance and guidance for having food..,2
Firstly the seeating space is less and the music for garden seating is really bad. Some of the items in food menu were good but my mood was dampened by the extremely bad service. This not a place to spend more time or chill.,0
"There is a cafe named Hyper Local Cafe in Manikonda ,I don‚Äôt know if this belongs to the same one but went to this place with certain expectations but was disappointed...it has quite a good experience,especially outside there is a nice setup ,leaving that apart ,food was not upto the mark ,Had Butter Naan and two chicken curries which really didn‚Äôt make me happy..they can improvise and can work on the taste

Food: 2.5/5
Ambience:4/5
People:4/5",1
"Best place to hangout...üòä
Food is really great...
Thanks Papiya for the service...üòä
Staff was reallly co-operative...
Ambience is really great, especially PDR(Private Dining Room) is awesome...üòçüëåüèª",2
The customer service was very bad. We ordered lobster and they served us prawns with lobster shells. After a lot of argument chef accepted that yes we add prawns. But as per me there was no lo aster meat. also everyone from waiter to manager were telling different things.,0
"They have this amazing IPL offer
600 for 4 pints & french fries
Nice ambience
A bit expensive otherwise
The view is really good spanning the whole city",1
"Discovered this place while returning from an despicable day at the office. Walked in, and ordered some food thinking it'd be the same takeout food one could get at any outlet.
But. But, the food turned out to be a saviour. And the way they've designed this place is indeed remarkable. The lights, and the mixed setup would give you a retro feel. Good for a normal group of people who would want to sit and a have a great conversation over food.",2
Visited this place about a month ago and they weren't very accommodating as we had our 5 month old baby with us which led us to walk out ASAP. They were relatively low on customer service with us but no complaints about the food. Tried the fish&chips and prawn curry with rice last week and was decent.,0
"The drunch trend has picked up in Hyderabad and Hyperlocal has joined in too.
The ambience is good although the place is pretty small and a bit cramped up. The utilisation of the limited space is done well. A good place to chill with your drinks and watch the sun set.
Moving on to the food: we tried the newly launched Drudge menu. Priced at Rs.1200, this was an expensive affair. However if you are early I.e before 4:30 pm then you can avail the same drunch for ‚Çπ 799.
They had a theme which Revolved around Delhi Street food.
The drinks menu was lovely and so were the drinks. We tried a couple of them and the mocktail of the day was the kiwi mint cooler.

The buffet Consisted of golgappe, Dahi bhalle, Sev puri, bruschetta, mini veg and non veg pizza, Dahi kachori, chole bhature, red Thai curry with rice, chicken tikka, fries, noodles and chicken tikka pockets.

Golgappe, Sev puri and dahi bhalle very really tasty and had that typical street food taste. Dahi kachori was a complete let down.
The bruschetta stood out and pizza was average.
Chole bhature were okay but the bhature weren't crisp.
The red Thai curry was a complete let down and tasted like a Chinese preparation.
Noodles were randomly kept with no gravy.
The chicken tikka pockets were dry.
The chicken tikka was good and marinated very well.
Overall the management needs to put a lot of thought in the menu planning as it the menu as a whole didn't go together. The idea of having so many chaat items for a drunch menu just doesn't sound correct.
The music was extremely loud for the place.
Overall we had a below average Experience.

Based on the drunch menu I would rate it 2.5/5",1
"Second time being here it's really beyond imagination beyond taste and beyond flavours as well. Very courteous staff and very hospitile.
Taste is good but the best part is presentation,,, it's really meeting the standard of a 5 star restaurant .
Very impressed with Mr Ahmed , Pradeep and Mr Dipanajan who are very friendly and took care of us very well. Good job guys keep it up.",2
"Too costly... Tastes just ok.. And the service people don't have any manners also... I have zomato gold and I went there... As we are going to get free starter... They started treating cheaply...
Warning : Never go with zomato gold they will throw cheap looks... And treat you cheaply...",0
Its a decent place for dinner. Decors and the service is average but the food is good. And the bar is fully loaded with great drinks. And the offers are also very attractive.,1
"We ordered Vegetable Lasagne and sizzler chicken tikka, both of which were absolutely delicious. The ambience is amazing and the service is good.",2
Very bad,0
"Visited Hyper Local for their newly launched Drunch buffet. The buffet spread is valid for weeekends and costs nearly 1200/- per person. The place itself is located in a good, open area inside SLN terminus and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer.

My experience with their food was decent. The Drunch layout comprised of North Indian inspired starters such as Dahi Bhalle, Dahi Vade, Gol gappe as well as Papdi chaat. I would have to say that they gave a decent shot to all these things. My favorite of the lot was their Golgappe.

Speaking about their main course, they had a really limited options consisting of Chole Bhature, Veg Hakka Noodles, Red thai curry, Chicken pizza, Steamed Rice, Chicken tikka, Chicken wings and Chicken pockets. Looking at the price of the drunch, I feel a bit more items should have been on offer. Their Chicken pizza and Chicken tikka were simply delicious. However, they need to work upon their Thai curry and the availability of other items in the layout.

The best part about the place was the drinks section. Loved the preparation of Wet Garden cocktail, Sangria and Cranberry Cooler. Special mention to the bar tender for a lovely range of drinks. One can give a try to their drinks whenever you get a chance to visit the place.

All in all, the experience would have much better if there would have been additional veg appetizers and a few main course dishes. Happy eating. :)",1
One of the best food experiences I had in hyderabad. The desserts was yum. Appricot pudding is must have. @Ahmed Khan your service was unparalled. Keep up the good work.,2
Bad for a Sunday lunch..the place might be good for evening ambiance but afternoon inside the closed..most ordinary rooms with no music.. just chatter of other guests is a mood spoiler. Extremely slow service. Food is tasty and that's the only reason one could visit the place.,0
"Hyper Local is situated in one such building which has various lounges and pubs. Despite that it has a reputed name and hype.
The place is widely spread evenly with three sections. Two sections on the inside and one section in the outer rooftop area.
The first inside section is inspired by the retro style whereas the other section is nearer to the bar. The two sections are contrasting with each other. The bar area is lighted up and you can grab your drink from there and even enjoying the bartender or the barmaid making your drink.
Hyper Local has introduced the trending ""Drunch"", a sundowner party on Sundays from 3pm to 7pm.
It includes unlimited food and drinks in Rs 1200/_.
The food for the drunch has a selected menu which comprises of starters, main course and dessert.
The drinks menu is wide though and has classic presentations.
Coming to food.... The menu is inspired from the Delhi region thus has the typical Delhi Street Style starters like Gol Gappe, Papdi Chaat, Matar Kulche,
Chole Bhature, and Dahi Vade.
The main course has a subtle style including Thai red curry, noodles, rice, chicken pockets, chicken tikka.
Dessert had the yummiest chocolate pastry which was very soft and yumm.
Drinks were amazing here. My personal favourite was Pina Colada, Fall Alert and Sangria wine from the menu.
Hyper Local is also streaming Live IPL matches so its a perfect blend of enjoying the match with food and drinks at your service at a place with lit Ambience.
Recommended!!!",1
"Ahmed was a great help in beyond flavour... He may suggest great food as he has good experience. The staters and sizzler was too good. The sauce that was use in the chicken dish was awsome. Nan was very soft even if you take without butter you can easily eat.
Great experience in beyond flavors.",2
"Waste of money...
The worst place nd the waiter's was not cooperative..we have to call nd ask them to bring the starter...zero star..one of the worst experience ever had..üëé",0
"Situated at the top floor of SLN terminus along with food court area.
Ambience and decor is pleasing.
Buffet doesn't do justice to price paid in terms of variety and service. We had to wait for bowls, spoons and refill of chutney etc.
They serve one veg soup, 2 veg starter, Live pasta which was also not upto the mark, 3 curry, Rice,biryani and different bread option. Gulabjamun and ice cream in dessert.",1
Had dinner at this place and the attendant was Papiya. The staff is very friendly and the ambiance is awesome. Good variety of food and beverages.,2
Be wary when you visit in summer. Very hot and not ventilated properly. Average food. Alcohol content in drinks are below average. Ambiance is good,0
"U will not find many veg items here. But the biryani quantity wise, it will be adequate quantity for both people. We ordered green veg gulati (not so good) and one veg biryani.",1
"Good Ambience with an absolutely delicious food.
I‚Äôve got best company here by ANANYA (Beyond Flavours)
The place is quite and has peaceful music with fun loving staff.
Great place for friends.",2
"Dun bombard the menu with so many things, great hospitality and tasty food is what makes a place happening. Not coming to this place ever again",0
"Ambience is good but not a lot of food options are there. Tried there mocktails which could have been better and the food was okay.
Increase the food and drinks options.",1
"It's one of the best places to hangout with friends. Seemed like a quiet common place for group lunches etc.
Food was very good and the ambience was also very nice.
Loved everything.‚ù§",2
"We have visited the place for Thursday Dinner buffet and kindly do not try it. They have very limited options of starters and the choice of spread was really poor. Even the selection of alcohol was very basic.
Service could be much better in the buffet section as the drinks order need to be provided. Overall it's a total disappointment.
Food - 2/5
Service - 3/5
Ambience - 4/5

Kindly do not try the evening buffet as it's very bad.",0
"Never disappoints me. Always up to my expectations. Great choices and I love the extra bits like the oreo's, m&m's etc to choose as toppings.",1

"Fisherman's wharf used to be our fav joint when we lived in Goa. Excellent food and bevs.
Then we moved to Hyderabad, FMW followed.
We were so happy, to have a Goan restaurant just 5 min drive from home.
In the beginning it was great place to dine. Then it started getting local. Fishes started getting stale, fewer varieties ..Not so great.
Now , after about 3 years, it's more a typical curry point.
We ordered Mutton Xacuti and Kingfish Richado.
Fish was so firm and overcooked, richado overloaded with sweetness.
Mutton was out of the world, with heaps of Curry leaves(Kadi patta/Karia paku) , super high on heat....Reminded me of a Rayala curry in Dindi (Godavari distt ). Meat was cooked with extra affection that it took me 5 min to chew it like a bubblegum. I really thank myself for not ordering more.
Fisherman's wharf- such a disappointment.",0
Cool place which will be available till 1pm in HYD beat icreams and very unique especially they have wide range of varieties in chocolate types and service is also quite good except their GM singing in the outlet :p,1
"This is the place where the flavor of food and service are like beyond good ,beyond expectations and really really quality and worth of money.i am personally highly recommend this place.great flavour of food and very much prompt service.ambience is also enhance the flavor of this restaurant.",2
"Hyderabad's most worst and ugliest biryani i had yesterday from the restaurant Eat fit and this worst restaurant people not allowing zomato people quick to the destination delivery points, it has been 2hr late i have received from the biryani from Eat fit, just disguised about the biryani of the EATFIT Alaasss.. this is a Horrible biryani i had ate in Hyderabad",0
"Its a creamstone, what can I say. Goodnicecream is my weakness. But this branch has just become super busy. Can you see how many zomato guys have lined up for the order.",1
This is the place I really recommend this restaurant to the food lover specifically the continental food lover.pasta and sizzlers are so yummy that I cant stop myself to choose only this restaurant rather than other.service is the part were you really satisfied.,2
"Last time I ordered the food(Tofu keema wrap, dal makhni and parathe) from here, I was delivered spoiled food. The wrap was literally smelling sour and parathe were like they have been prepared in the morning and sent to us for dinner. I always order from this restaurant and since it was the first time, I wanted to ignore this But, still putting out this review so that management can introspect and figure out if this was process fault, delivery fault or a manual one.",0
"It's a ever busy place that reeks of laughter & sugar in the air. The cream stone brand is ever known , but what sets apart gachibowli from others is it's courteous staff & ambient seating area. Its a go to place for ISB, IIIT & HCU students.",1
"I'm very much impressed by the quality of food and service. Specially Mr Ahmed, thank you for your politeness and readiness. About food i can only say that it is beyond flavours. Loved this place. Must visit, great ambience.",2
I received food with a live green insect in it. What food standards are being followed! This is not expected from a restaurant with an ‚Äòexcellent hygiene‚Äô title!,0
"They didn't packed the ice cream nicely ie.. didn't keep any dry ice, because of that it got melted and spreads in the pckage. A bit disappointed other than that taste is good.",1
The food was indeed beyond falvours. Ahmed served us well. Hoping to meet next time soon. A great ambience and amazing songs on the background added innumerous flavours to the delicious food.,2
Zomato please help me to give them negative rating to this restaurant. I fell sick after eating their roti. How awful it is. If your food not good your packaging will not give u business,0
"The food is economically reasonable. The North Indian dishes including chole kulche, chole bhature and paneer butter masala are comparatively better than the chaats.",1
Starters are very good and service is also good. Ahmed is very polite and helped us selecting menu.l which tuned out be great. Would like to come back again.,2
Food was open,0
"Their gol gappa is a must try. It is different from what we get in Hyderabad. Chole bhature was also good. Ignore the attitude of the staff, especially the one at the counter.",1
Lovely ambience..Roasted chicken soup was the Highlight of our dinner..Basket biryani was full of flavours and yumm.lasagne was great.Nice to go with whole family.Appetisers quantity is less though.,2
very less quantity and food taste also not gud,0
I have been visiting/ordering from this place for over 2 years now. Chaats here used to be amazing but the quality these days has gone down.,1
"Awesome food, very good ambience, centrally located, ample parking....coordination between serving boys / service has scope for improvement, boys very courteous though. Not sure why the bar was closed on a Saturday evening....Overall good experience & extremely value for money....will visit again!",2
"they don't deliver your food. They charge for food but may deliver only half of the order. and when contacte Zomato tell you that Restaurant no. is switched off. Strange, are they in food delivery busines or this is something else? beware",0
"Not the place if you belong to northern India. No doubt, the hygiene is well maintained but food is not as delicious as I expected it to be. Service is quick though. Also they dishes are quite overpriced.",1
"I really enjoyed the follows....
The entrance, the music, lighting, seating arrangement, decorations everything is just awsome. The food and the best service enhance the flavour of the restaurant. I realy recommend this restaurant...",2
I ordered lunch from here and it took them 1 hr 45 minutes to prepare the food and then another 15 minutes for Zomato to deliver. Zomato was apologetic and gave some credits but I am never going to order from this restaurant. Also the food was below average. I ordered Tofu Keema roll.,0
"Ordered paav bhaji chole bhature and papdi chat!
But they forgot to deliver the chat!I was a bit disappointed by that.But the taste was good.",1
"I came first time in this restaurant.
The entrance, the music, lighting, seating arrangement, decorations everything is just awsome. The food and the best service enhance the flavour of the restaurant.",2
Ordered a Wok tossed millets a few months back and had a major stomach upset. The quality of food seemed really bad that time. Although I tried reaching out to Zomato customer care quite a few times they ended conversations saying someone from eat.fit team will get back. Till date I haven't received any response from either Zomato or Eat.fit,0
"I ordered paneer butter masala, paneer quality is best but gravy is not tasty.",1
Ahmed was serving us. Polite and very cooperative staff..Amazing food and Ambience..Veg gilaffi Kabab and Lasgna was a must try..Loved overall experience....,2
Hey Guys!! I ordered Chicken biryani from eat fit and i must say this wasn't a good experience at all...The only plus point can be given for good packaging. But packaging doesn't count as we pay for good food. The biryani didn't even taste like a biryani. It was more like fried rice with chicken dumped. üò£ Had a very bad experience...,0
"Sardarji's chaats and more is synonymous with the typical street food in Delhi and is nostalgia served in a plate all over (for people who have for any point of time savored on the street food in delhi).

The sandwiches, especially the samosa grilled one is a unique concept and tastes incredibly awesome. The dahi bhalla, dahi papdi's are good too. 
However, off late i get the dishes home delivered most of time time via zomato and there are fluctuations in the food.

Another complaint i had with them are their parathas, they are bad, polar opposite to their chaat dishes. I would never recommend anyone ordering paratha's from this place and I tried twice and on occasions they were under stuffed and undercooked. This is the reason I have rated them as 3 out 5.",1
Paradise Biryani is really good service also good staff friendly ambiance nice I had chicken Biryani and mutton Biryani both are good thank you,2
"Why on earth would someone charge 185 rs for 3 regular sized thin chapathis and a bowl of chicken curry. Unless the buyers are fools.
Terrible pricing and quantity for the money.
2 stars just for decent taste of curry.
All those mentions of calories and stylish packaging are unnecessary if you can‚Äôt have sufficient food inside.
Oh boy, will never try üôèüèªüôèüèª

Btw, the dish name is chefs special nonveg thali üòÇ",0
"I went to the Himagiri Hospital and when I came out of there I really felt hungry, and so my sister suggested that we should go to this place as this place serves excellent Punjabi Food... I ordered Chole Bature and lassi... Trust me the type of lassi which I had over there, I had exactly that kind only in Punjab and nowhere else... The Chole Bature too was delicious...
But I didn't like the ambiance... Just try to work on that... Otherwise Everything is upto the mark...

Ambiance-2.5/5
Food-5/5
Service-3.5/5",1
"Chiken biryani is very good and
Spcal chiken cary is very good and testy food
And
So enjoy the food and
Next time visiting again with my family and friends",2
Worst food ..... I would never order from this again... I ordered lucknowi biryani .... That turned out bullshittt.... It looked like timato chutney rice ....,0
packing is not good,1
"Very good hospitality,good ambiance and very good food ,v good facility of packing biriyani to long distances good place to visit mainly for Hyderabad biriyani",2
Ordered bread omelette with roast potato wedges and it failed to impress me. By bread omelette I was expecting bread wrapped with omelette but it was separate. Omelette tasted good. Bread was plain and hard. There were only two normal/medium sized roasted potato wedges. It tasted ok. Along with wedges were two chunks of roasted potato. English style and all is good but it is important to know how people eat a particular vegetable in a region. Neither one likes to chew a whole tomato nor one is capable of gulping it down. This was a major let down. There was rajma type curry which tasted ok. This whole dish was out of the way.,0
"Located in Indira nagar, This outlet serves chats along with limited tandoor and Punjabi style main course dishes. Ordered paneer butter masala half along with rumali roti and butter naan. Prices were reasonable and pocket friendly. Less than 200 bucks AI.

Paneer butter masala was extra tangy, unlike traditional restaurant style dishes. Paneer quantity was very less, 4 small pieces served in a cup of smooth textured gravy. Tandoori items tasted good. Ordered earthen pot cooled milk in the end, with chat masala added, 30 bucks per glass.",1
"Good Food and Tasty, better to have music while having food, better have quick response...and everything other than these are good. And good environment",2
Delivery boy was reluctant to the deliver the order and was unable to navigate the maps. He reached to different location and when I was trying to navigate him he said he don‚Äôt know the address which was mentioned,0
This was very first time in south that i heard alot about northern delicacy Chole bhature... But i would say i am disappointed with the taste as it is nowhere near to what it should be.... And prices are also very high...,1
Goodtaste...ever.... paradise makes magic.chefs will gladly prepare it the way u prefer. They are nice to serve everyone...this is the world best biryani.,2
I ordered from this place from Zomato. The amount of food was almost negligible but the price was extorbitant. I ordered anti oxidant kick and potato flakes. The juice was ordinary and hardly 150ml. The potato flakes nothing more than normal Haldiram mixture. I am definitely not ordering next time.,0
Again left the salad in the order,1
Food quality is good..but some.takes more time when the food arrives.but food taste was too good..staff was good..perfect for family for lunch or dinner...enjoy,2
"Food quality and quantity is not up to mark. A family pack of chicken biriyani comes with 430 RS and it contains only 2 pretty small pieces and rice relatively very less. No raita or salan given. Not at all worth for money.
Quality is also not very good, didn't feel anything great about , worst place to order food. Sorry however that's the reality.. Thanks.",0
"Ordered Samosa, aloo Tikki with chutney, papdi dahi bhalla, sev batata puri.
Samosa with chutney was good, liked it
Papdi dahi bhalla was good
Didn't like the taste of sev batata puri,
Did not like aloo Tikki, it was not freshly made , felt like the potato was spoilt
Chole bhatoore was good and pav bhaji was ok.
Didn't like the taste of Bhel Puri.",1
"Tasty food with good service , enjoyed a lot at paradise, quick response from the providers , fast delivery,tasty food ,good place ,good for economic people",2
"I found a small wooden stick in the tofu keema wrap I ordered from eat.fit. Apparently, not so hygenic and healthy as they claim themselves to be!",0
Chole was too oily..,1
Ordered one chicken and one mutton biryani and it was very good. Paradise is definitly a great restaurant for biryani. Restaurant ambinence is good along with quick service.,2
I had ordered veg pulav and egg masala bowl no egg and no taste pulav have no vegetables even restaurant took 1 hour to give it to the delivery boy this is ridiculous ü§¨ü§¨,0
have only one packet of curry instead of 2,1
"Always the best , my all time favorite food, biryani ka baap , every time I visit I feel something special, I almost visited 20 times , simply the best",2
"Have ordered from here multiple times but today the food wasn't up to standards. Ordered 'Chef's Special Combo for 2'. The salad and raita smelled bad. Weren't fresh. Had to throw them away. You folks have made a name, stick to its standards.",0
"I am a big fan of BBQ nation since a decade now. This however was my most dissatisfying experience to date, after visiting several of their locations across the country including this one in the past.

The only thing they handled well, from the word go was the seating. I booked a table for 14 from zomato. It was ready for us when we arrived.

Everything else seemed to be falling apart, their team was struggling to deliver.

The starters took forever to be served. Most of them tasted similar though were called different things, refills were small portions and we had to keep requesting for more which is unlike how bbq manages things. The mocktails seemed watered down and on highlighting this, some were duly replaced.

The chef did come to check on us and on sharing our experience justified that our palate was confused due to tasting several dishes. When we held our ground, he went back to personally create some dishes. His version of the starters were way better but we were done eating by then.

I would like to highlight that the servers and chef were trying every bit to run around to meet requirements but seemed overwhelmed and struggled to get great food to the table.

Hope this was just a bad day and this outlet will get its act together.",1
Good taste and love to visit again ...... With my family and friends... Hopefully enjoyed the taste of biryani.... And make this happens every time,2
"Had ordered veg pulao & rajma, it didn't seem fresh .. however I consumed it & couldn't sleep whole night because of vommiting & loose motion.
Will never order food from eat.fit again.",0
"Friday afternoon, We planned team lunch (veg & non-veg) in Gachibowli Barbecue Nation. We were asked several times to give excellent rating by various attendants which was quiet annoying while we were having lunch even though food & variety served was average and wasn't upto standard w.r.t taste & variety.

In short, it wasn't value for money. 

I think it would be better to choose Absolute Barbecue over Barbecue Nation, as customer you get value for money. Seems like now Barbecue Nation is just riding on its legacy.",1
"As usual the food is always good - world famous biryani.
I love to eat Paradise Biryani where ever i am.
Service n Ambiance are also very good.",2
"I have ordered kachori & chana chaat for home delivery from zomato. I was expecting a quality food as this was not my first order from eat.fit ( previously ordered food quality being good). As soon as I opened the box bad smell was coming, then realised it was from the chana chaat and not kachori's. The chana chaat has gone bad and was not fresh due to which kachori's were also smelling bad. I had to throw away everything. I don't think I can order again with trust on their food quality.",0
Who doesn't like BBQ and having it from BBQ Nations is a good experience. Chicken tikka nadi fish are really tasty. As part of new year celebration there were some new dishes which was passable. Expected better in desserts,1
"We ordered tandoori chicken as starters that's very tasty and light and then butter naan with mutton masala and as main course we ordered chicken biryani, egg and mutton biryani those are very very tasty and light mutton piecs cooked with perfection",2
The taste was OK and food seems healthy. For the prices that we have the quantity is way less. Doesn't fill half your stomach. Overpriced. Worthless!!!,0
It used to be one of my favourite places and the destination for all family celebrations. However over the time I feel it has lost that touch. There is no more aawww feeling when u eat at this place. They don‚Äôt compromise on the quality of food but I was disappointed with the taste. We tried at both forum mall and gachibowli branches and it felt the same.,1
"Very fri approach and services, especially by Shri Krishan. Very excellent service rendered. Dishes are very tasty. Like to visit again and will recommend to friends.",2
very poor food and my items were missing,0
We went to barbeque nations for thanks giving special day team lunch.Items are good. But service is very slow. We waited for long time for food items after ordered.Deserts and starters are nice.,1
"Order: drumsticks and chicken biryani

Just awesome taste and good service

5* rating

Good response from service boys and good serving

Good seating",2
"AVOID. This place is a scam. If there is even a place: I cannot find the physical restaurant on google maps by the provided address. Anyway, I ordered a healthy chicken breast dish. They claim to offer healthy dishes and organic ingredients which look fantastic on the photos. Then you get regular oily fatty suspiciously-saucy Indian takeaway full of sugar and complex carbohydrates, probably from some nearby restaurant or street food stand. The only healthy thing about it was the size of the portion. No wonder it is low on calories: you can literally finish the whole plate in 4 bites. There were exactly 2 small chunks of chicken on it, maybe 25gr total, submerged in some ketchup based sweet sauce. I doubt it was even grilled. It looked and tasted more like it was fried, although with the disgusting oily sauce sugar coating it all who knows. The picture of the plate showed a full bowl of grilled chicken breast only, plus the sides on other plates. I should have taken a photo to show on this review and compare with the one on the menu but I was too hungry and mad to think about anything but eating the disappointing food. At least it wasn't too expensive, but definitely not healthy, not cheap, and not good quality food.",0
"To start with , the complimentary drinks Blue mojito , pacific blue , fresh lime soda were refreshing. The nonveg starters were all with subtle flavours and requires some attention for increasing taste be it lemon chicken , prawns or fish. Head chef made chinese schezwan chicken starter which has made our day. The veg starters - Mushroom is a immediate No , cripsy corn was not salted properly , paneer came as a saviour. Maincourse was not that luring or exciting but to mention malai kofta was a star performer. Coming to Desserts : Its either too dry or too sweet or too chilled. Browine was too dry , cakes were not tasty, apple/pineapple jelabi was overdosed with sugary syrup , phirni an absolute no , kulfi was too chilled that u will feel as if u r eating ice but if u allow it to drop to room temperatures then u can feel the flavour of it. Overall watermelon n papaya came as a saviour in dessert section. I can only rate it 3 for food , 5 for service , 3 for ambience as its too crowded going neck to neck in every counter.",1
The food and the hospitality of the staff is amazing and the service was very fast ambience of the place is really good i really recommened everyone to try kadai chicken,2
"Can you explain, how spicy food is healthy? In addition to this, the chapatis were super dry and both vegetables were tasteless. Not worth the wait and money of course.",0
"This was my first time at a ""Barbeque Nation."" I've heard great things about it, people sounded like they serve food from heaven.
Now, let me tell you about my experience at this outlet, not going to judge the other outlets. The service was not good, we had to call em' more than thrice to get the starters served, the chicken tasted stale, fish and prawns were amazing though. They were serving complimentary drinks, I selected ice tea, worst one I've ever had.
The good thing about this place, their ""manager,"" he knew we weren't happy, tried his best to make things right for us, made the chef come to our table, which felt good and cared for.
I liked the ambience of this place, will definitely give another chance to this outlet ‚úåÔ∏è",1
Service was good and food also good ambiance good I had chicken biriyani and egg biriyani both are really good nice service with good food overall good,2
Overpriced crap on the name of healthy food. The food industry has become a dark business nowadays looting customers on the name of healthy food. Quantity is too less at the price they sell.,0
"Visited it along with my friend for dinner buffet last week. 

Most of the starters were served slowly. Even after repetitive reminding no response from the staff. Fish starters were not well cooked. Chicken starters & crispy corn were good.

Mains and desserts were good as usual, not much different from others.",1
"I ordered Chicken biryani and egg biriyani. Food is awesome, very nice place and great ambitious. Will definitely come again next time and service is too good....",2
"You need to improve your packing. Had ordered veg Thai green curry with rice. By the time it was delivered to me, curry had splashed all over the container , even leaking from package. Zomato delivery person said it leaked while getting it. Had second thoughts abt whether to consume it or not.",0
"Barbeque‚Äôs are famous for their huge spread in the starters range, so was this place. Have almost visited most of the barbeques in the city. Similar menu and nothing outstanding in this restaurant. Taste was average.
Staff were very polite and the service was good. Loved the pan kulfi.",1
"Friendly. Nice service chicken biryani is delicious
Curry bowl design nice... Nice temp nice as cooling nice tooth pics nice spot for selfie nice restaurant settings",2
Taste is not good and also not freshly prepared. It seems food was cooked at afternoon and delivered during evening for dinner. Also not spicy.,0
"When we first tried, that was 8months back.. the food taste and the quantity was good. Now they seems very much focused on offers not the quantity and quality of food. Very disappointed on my next two visits;They started reducing the quantity of the main dish in their Sizzlers, seems now the main dish is just for topping to attract.",1
Very nice and humble staff. Very tasty biryani. Many people told me that try another place but paradise is truly paradise for biryani lovers.,2
"I ordered Thai chicken rice. First of all, it is on the expensive side. Second, the quantity wasn't good, third it was spicy. Seems like they are spending more on fancy packaging than the actual food.",0
Good sizzler taste. Portion size may be too much for a single person. They were kind enough to share all the sauces extra to mix and have different tastes.,1
Nice restaurant with friendly and courteous staff and variety of options to choose from. The curry and raita are really good. There are some good options for veggies also that they can try.,2
I have ordered for one item oat meal and received another item ghar rasma veg pulao. Which is not satisfactory and wastage of food and money.,0
The Mixed Biryani is good. But need to improve the presentation and the portion. The pieces are not cooked properly. Better to check this except that all ok.,1
Food is good and the staff is very humble. Had a great time with my people üòçgood service good food nise ambiance no 1 biriyani in hybd not hybd in india,2

The food I ordered was Masala egg curry with Vegetable Pulao with Order Id: 1676056120

Zomato delivery guy when delivered I realized that curry was spilling from the box. When enquired he said this is packaging problem.
After Zomato incident all the restaurant have changed their packing but eat.fit seems to be not bothered. 
After opening the box the food was just half a bowl. Rice taste seems to be of very low quality. Bad service from eat.it and from Zomato.

My first and last order from eat.fit. Already uninstalled Zomato . Overall very unpleasant experience.",0
"Mostly overrated

Went with my wife today by seeing the 3.9 stars. The place is small and too much crowded. There are very less number of servers compared to footfalls. Now coming to food, ordered chicken drumsticks,but taste was not that great then ordered one non veg sizzler which was also not that great. Noodles in the sizzler were tasteless. Overall did not find the experience which we were expecting.",1

"This restaurant has no mention of contact details on their web page
And after a long hard work I found one contact through zomato customer service .....which was also WRONG
This shows the professionalism and attitude of this restaurant
They have three to four branches in hyderbad but none of them have provided any contact number
Moreover zomato also registers as adds restaurants without taking proper details from them

Poor show

I would give a half star

Horrible experience with eat.fit",0
"I had ordered the smoked chicken pasta in red sauce. I wouldn't say it was the worst, but it was not up there. There was no smokiness like the name claimed, just bland chicken and rather a trail mix of vegetables that didn't really need to be there in it, in the first place. I would suggest revamping this particular recipe with lesser no. of vegetables (maybe cut the bell peppers and baby corn out). Also, the ""smoked chicken"" needs to be upgraded. The spaghetti was also slightly overcooked.",1

Nizam chicken biryani too good.
Pepper chicken very tasty

"I ordered their Special Chicken Shawarma from Zomato. First look it was quite heavy for one shawarma. The quantity is huge but coming to cons which is a quality.It is not at all good. The chicken was hard and unnecessarily they made it too spicy also. It usually stays open late night but don't order from here still.The quality needs to improve a lot.
Stay healthy. Keep eating..not from here.
Cheers",0
"It was an ok ok place ambiance was quite ok
Every item in the menu was costly and the sizzler was also not upto the mark
Serving was a bit slow and preparation time was high more or less it was not a fine dining experience",1

Value for money. Great ambience.
Highly recommended.
Prices a bit high.
But definitely worth it",2
"Delivery Review :

Ordered a Chicken Rumali Shawarma.

The chicken was so hard that it was very difficult to chew.

Also the spice levels are very high so please add an extra note if you want less spicy.

Overall it was okayish.

Had to throw away half of it as both Rumali and the Chicken were very chewy.

Giving 2 star because they didn't add mayo as requested.

Overall it is just okay and you can definitely find better ones in the city.",0
taste good but quantitt is very less for the money paid,1
Good food and good service. Good options for vegetarians also. Desserts are very tasty. Ambience is also neat and the place looks very hygienic,2
While I am eating my food I get this in my food the steel wire it cut my tongue inside. The worst experience while having my food i am suggesting don't buy shawarma from shah ghouse,0
"Been to this place along with friends for a small party,We loved the place & but only concern was service associates were rude &Helpless..When we complained for burned naan was served then the server stated that we serve Naan likes this only,He didnot even apologised...very pathetic experience we had...",1

One who delivered, he was saying that you had ordered only one... When I spoke with the person of hotel who answered my call, said that it may be delivery boys fault,
Seems that no value for customer queries...",0
"I had gone to this place for team dinner. The place is in a mall and has a good ambience. We ordered many starters and drinks. The food was decent, nothing special. It is a good place to party and dance.",1
The food was especially haleem. People who hate mutton smell but wanted to taste haleem can go try this restaurant. Service and ambience was cool.,2
Not very pleasant experience with Shawarmas here. Was very tasty but got hard time digesting. Unpleasant burps until took medicine. And it was not only me but my friend also experienced same.,0
"It was a night out with gal pals.

When we entered, the server took us to our sitting area , we chose a corner, as it had a couch ,felt it was bit secluded.

Warm indoors, black and brown seatings, cartoons of laal street, their sensex of drinks prices being displayed in the TV.

They have their own app for ordering , but guess what their wifi wasn't available ,as it was under repair. That is what server told us.

The server came and took our orders.

We ordered starters and drinks.

As soon as he left we saw a rat running to hide somewhere.

It kind of scared us , then we thought every place has them but still if its running freely what might be the state of infestation.

Then we started enjoying the music and our orders came. The server got one of the drinks wrong, we reminded him it was changed ,he said he already brought this.

Other places, the server would have taken it back and would have apologized atleast. Instead he said he cant take it back.

Anyways moving on

The cocktail which i had were really good. The cosmopolitan, Beer trap and Screw driver.

The starters which we ordered the portions we felt were a bit small. I can only talk about veg starters as i am a vegetarian. Italian cheese fingers - They were crispy and yum, Stuffed mushrooms - they were okay and forgettable, the Nachos were okay , have had better ones . The crispy corn was good . Last but not the least the soft noodles though good but felt the portion was even smaller than the other starters.

The music was good , Being a bollywood night we requested DJ to play it, first they said at 9.30 they will start ,then said 10.30 it will start. We four were only on the dance floor , we requested multiple times to play atleast one bollywood song. He didnt oblige at all.

Would playing one peppy bollywood song really degrade his skills ? God knows.

Food and hospitality are an important criteria for any eating place be it a restaurant or a bar.

Hope they improve their hospitality. That is one of the major reasons one goes back to one place again and again.

"I ordered a chicken rumali shawarma just now from this place and added instructions in my order NOT to put that slimy, greasy ""mayonnaise"" some of these places are famous for. Lo and behold : opening the food parcel was the item with the awful slimy, sickening mayo I had requested not to be added!  And I might add - there was only meat and mayo - no vegetables such as included in shawarma ordered from better places (this was listed as ""special shawarma"").",0

So nice and enjoy the food. Next time visit again soon with my friends",2
The shawarma roll had uncooked meat! I got pieces of bones too! I'm very much disappointed with Shah Ghouse spl Shawarma! The quantity may be sufficient enough but quality matters more. If uncooked...it is good for nothing.,0
"Since its close to the it crowd, been here numerous times. I like the music and drinks as well. Food is not their fort√®. You've to be very selective in that. Would recommend to go for starters. I've tried buffet here as well which I didn't personally like. The ambience is cool though but the staff has been unaccommodating to us one time.",1
"Awesome biryani and kebabs. Apollo fish is the best one here.
Clean and hygienic food.
Courteous staff and prompt service response.

Nice staff food is good and tasty....ambience is good..service is good and staff is very polite with customers......overall food is great woowwwwwww,2
It was not the same like before. There were big big pieces of chicken instead of cutting them into smaller pieces.,0

Chicken is so hard to eat cant eat it..i informed about this to zomato they are not responding nd either restaurant not responding ..dont try Shawarma here nd ruin ur health,0
"Filtered entry - Check
Welcome assistance - Check
Crowd - Check
Ambience - Check

What's great? Nothing.

It's a good sports bar with zero sense of consumer experience when it comes to to service and value for money. Half the order doesn't come on time, you'll have to repeatedly pesture your waiter who just keeps running half the time.

The fancy sports bar is not adequately staffed and even though they filter the crowd by putting a stag entry fee which is covered, too many people are stiffed inside and I don't think they have the ability to serve the kind of crowd they attract.

Overall, I liked the food and the place but it was a disappointment that night. We left to a more peaceful place for the rest of night.

The cocktails are good though.",1
Very good service and excellent food chicken biryani mutton biryani both are good ambience also very nice good staff overall good food good service happy time,2
"One of my chauffeur in Hyderabad recommended this place for authentic Persian food. And I was disappointed. This place didn't live upto the fame and name. The meat wasnt well cooked. The taste was bland. The service was fast, however the quality of service was a disappointment. A cold finger bowl at the end made it worst. Ambiance 0/5, service 2.5/5, staff 3.5/5, food 1/5, value for money 1.5/5.",0
"The ambience is very nice, the place has both indoor and outdoor setting. The staff is polite.
The food however didn't excite me much, the music was average and the rate fluctuations for drinks (the main concept of the place) seemed more static and less interesting.
The cocktails didn't taste that well either. We ordered a Chicken Noodles didn't taste as per the grandeur of the place. The biryani was good. We also ordered LITs which were not up to the mark at all.",1

For the first time when I has shawarma here it was great and thought of ordering it again... but the issue with these kind of places is that they just serve good food until they are famous and once done the quality descends drastically... the best shawarma I had is at SK Shawarma DLF and other opposite to food bazar nizampet...,0
"The drinks were good, the food was mediocre, the service was pathetic.
The waiter asked us when are we leave, apparently they overbooked, and even the service was slow.",1

Chicken taste is not good,0
"The DJ who plays at this place is really good. We went in a group of 10 people and enjoyed a lot. On the downside, the food and drinks service is really slow and number of waiters are less as compared to seating strength of the place.

The people on bar counter suck big time as they don't talk properly, give you respect and try to loot you by saying half of the low price drinks are not available.",1
"Mutton biryani was nice and awesome, chicken tikka was great it was my favourite... The service was nice and polite we had nice time here will visit soon finally upto mint thats great",2
i ordered chicken shawarma it‚Äôs a worst experience the chicken gets spoiled and smells we threw it away. very worst experience stay away from this restaurant.,0
"The Lal Street is been good for the first time. Today I went and booked a table, where we have not been given a table and was asked to stand at the bar. Then after a wait of nearly 40mins staff arranged the table for us, where there was no-one to entertain us and take our order. We sat for around another half hour requesting the waiters to take our order. Then suddenly being Saturday night, the music went so so loud that it started hurting our ears and we were not able to talk even sitting side by side. Everyone want their Saturday night to be groovy but the music was literally hurting our ears. No doubt music played by DJ was awesome that it was making everyone dance on the floor.
Food was fine though but ambience is good.",1
Had a good time and best service...near place to come. Food is very tasty and good. Good good good food very nice restaurant. We would like to come over again and again thank you so much the tasty food,2

Generally we get best shawarmas here but I had very bad experience of packing and delivery executive.",0
Looks interesting at the entrance and has an intriguing ambience. The food is good and staff is cooperative but less responsive. The seating arrangement is comfortable for a person to relax. The Paneer Kathi Roll is a must have!,1
Taste of the biriyani is well defined with the taste of flavour .The price of the biriyani is quite more .but leaving that the service of the staffs is Good and secure,2
very poor food,0
"Great place, awesome music and great ambiance but waiters are unfriendly. Though I can recommend this place for the fun atmosphere and good music",1

very bad packing n item.....the restuarant rating 4.1 and the food was not matching....its so DISAPPOINTED.......!,0
"Visited this place with my friends strong recommendation and great reviews seen.

To be honest it didn't live up to the great reviews and great reputation it has.

Food spread is huge and too many varieties are there so a big thumsup for the same.

Quality of food is not wow but very average, prawn barbeque and chicken was very average.

Service is good and taken good care of.

Ambience was ok, it was feeling hot and we were sweating inside.

All in all a average ok experience.",1
I like the way the staff treats the customers... And the coolest thing I've seen is the food presentation.. And also the food.. That's tooo good especially the supreme chicken Biryani,2
badWe are ordered at around 5pm but that's delivered by 7:15pm,0
Burger was okay....But the chicken piece was not good and i was confused to find out which piece of chicken is that..So please look for a good piece of chicken when people ordering through online or else KFC will start loosing customers..,1
The biryani was good.The service is good.suggest everyone to visit.Its a good place to come with the family and it's a place where you can visit again and again,2
I believe the food was spoilt because of which we fell ill that night.,0

But due to the trust on shah Ghouse ordered it.. And initially shawarma quality use to be very good and now full of mayonnaise and and no dry fruits added to it.. I last order I thought it was by mistake he forgot but even yesterday I ordered shawarma and he repeated the same.. Food quality In shah Ghouse getting bad day by day,0

Had visited for lunch buffet.to my surprise at 2 pm most of the dishes were hardly left and were not replenised.also service is slow had to wait even to pay bill inspite of the fact that it was half occupied.had much more expectations for that price range.definitly not value for money.,0

"Ordered Mutton Haleem. It was awesome! Taste of it has been really exceptional while comparing with the big names as pista house & shah ghouse. Definitely try, if you are found of Haleem.",2
Pathetic restuarant. I had to struggle even for getting a table. Once you pay cover charge you are on your own to struggle. They messed up with everything. I ordered chilly paneer they got me chilly chicken. I mean how can a restuarant do this. After that I had to ask manager atleast 3 4 times to get every order. It took them more then 45 minutes to get me my order. It was over crowded no space to dance so people were dancing near our table and drinks spell off 3 4 times. On complaining about this nobody was even bothered to check. And at last when I saw my bill almost 3 4 items were included which we never ordered. Horrible experience. I wasted my money time and energy.,0

"Well this is the first time I ordered from NorFest - The Dhaba. I ordered for mutton combo meal which contains rice, dal makhani, 2 paratha and mutton with a pocket pinch of Rs. 400. However, very disappointed with the quantity of food. At that price range they are not providing a proper portion . Moreover the mutton was well cooked but out of 4 small pieces, 2 of them had bones and no meat . Kindly donot deceive your customers like this with good packaging . I gave three star only for the quality .",1
"Friendly staff,ambience is so good,hygiene ,got to know about the history of paradise and the biryani here is must and should try anyone can fall in love with this",2
"All services delayed, menu changes, very limited options in snack and food when asked they say it‚Äôs menu from Delhi and can‚Äôt help. Inspite of bill crossing 10k extremely reluctant to leave ice bucket on table. Asked for French fries without chillies twice but no help still after so much time fresh fries are not in. Ok last one came finally when THE MANAGER arrived after being aggressive. They want to offer free drinks but it‚Äôs not about money but experience, will share great review next time if we get one as we promised the manager to come back.",0
"Last time I ordered mutton rogan josh from here, it was amazing but today it was not fresh and only bones, no meat. It‚Äôs sad my favourite restaurant is going down in quality",1
"Ambiance is very good and food was very good and we all have tasted different flavours our office team had a very good time ,staff were very polite and friendly",2
"This was my second visit to the place and I am very disappointed for the following reasons:

1) The first time I visited they were not serving alcohol due to some license issue

I dicided to give it another shot and came again.

2) Ordered cheese chilli toast, never order it. It's as hard a a rock. Cheese all dried up and all you can taste is toasted white bread

3) Ordered moong daal chilla it was just fine raw onion ruined it for me

4) DJ was pathetic. It was supposed to be ""Bollywood Hangover"" he kept playing some bad music and it was too loud to order food without yelling in waiter's ear let alone having a conversation with your friends.

PS: If you are playing hollywood atleast play some thing that people hear, unnecessarily mixing on popular song does not make you a good DJ. You need feel the pulse of audience.",0
"The place is located in the food court of SLN Terminus and the first branch of Norfest in the city. The seating is in the food court and the kiosk has the dhaba feel with copper vessels on the counter containing the frequent items like rice and chole.

As it was winter we were fortunate to have Makki ki Roti and Sarson ka Saag. The Makki ki Roti was a bit thick served with homemade white butter or makhan, Saag was good but lacked salt in it. The flavor was decent mix of sarson and garlic peices in it.

The next thing was Amritsari Kulcha and Chole, a must try and must have at Norfest. The Kulcha alone is sufficient to fill one person, the chole along with it might be a bit less but they do refill. The taste of the Kulcha is great but if your luck is bad you can get a less filled kulcha as well. The Chole is the perfect compliment to it and tastes good.

The final dish was the Paneer Lababdaar and Garlic Naan, the curry again lacked salt, and was not upto the mark in terms of taste. So overall not recommended.

VFM: 4/5
Taste: 3/5",1

"#Heavy Punjabi Food
A perfect place to savor typical Dhaba style Punjabi Dishes. 
A popular outlet for home delivery, however place has common food court space available for dine-in as well. 
Food was served hot and tastes yumm.
Chola masala : Paneer was dominating the quantity of Chola.",1
The taste of the food is good. The varieties as well are many. They can work on the ambience of the restaurant. Service was pretty fast. Overall if you are a fan of biryani. You can visit it as many times as you can.,2
"Pathetic experience I have had in recent times. Arrived for buffet at 2pm I. Saturday afternoon. The food was cold as ice, no starters at the food table and support staff least bothered about checking on food and customers.

The only thing that was severed as per it's level was the welcome drink and unsatisfied food experience.

Until raising voice at the restaurant and threarting them on not paying the is when they got the attention and realized that shit food was cold.

Later is when they got the hot food which no variety and disappointed good experience.

Will not prefer anyone to visit this place and was a disappointing experience for a office team lunch and regret choosing this place as option.

Really disappointed",0
"They definitely promise you a decent meal.

Known for their timely delivery and packaging norfest doesn't disappoint you.

üçóNonveg starter platter is more than enough for two people. Perfectly cooked two pieces of Tangdi kebab, malai kebab and angara kebab might not leave a lasting impression but in general they are well marinated and taste good.

üç± Punjabi Non veg thali is perfectly packed meal box from saladü•ó to raita.

üçõ In a non-veg thali veg curries definitely need no mention but no one can ignore dal makhani. Wake up the dal makhani by stirring it as all the dal sunks to the bottom and sleeps. Felt it can be a bit thicker in consistency.

ü•òButter chicken was so delicious and mild in spicies(‚úîÔ∏è).

üç™Butter rotis were hard and tough to tear - the usual packaging side effects.

"Very good service and food, chicken lollipop was delicious and so was the chicken biryani, large portions so you won‚Äôt be left hungry, please do visit",2
The food is cold even after repeated requests for warm food. The service is pathetic and slow.. Am sure this place is going to close in couple of months. Will never visit again even if they offer free buffet. This was the experience of everyone who were at the restaurant this afternoon.,0
"Had been to this place for dinner we ordered fallout I kebab for starters that was quiet decent.For main course we ordered dal makhni,butter chicken,paneer lababdar and lacha paratha.Dal makhni was good and even their butter chicken was tasty with lacha paratha.But their lababdar was not authentic.Finished with sweet lassi again was not that great.Overall good food.",1

I visited the place last week. The food was tasty and so was ambience but I have serious concern with the services.

We asked for regular water , and they brought dirty, stinky water just to sell the bottled water. The waiter made facial remarks as in this is what you get for free.

It was highly irresponsible.
Also we had to literally beg them to bring the cheque.

Please train your staff if you want to .",0

Ambience was good, went on a weekday, very less crowded. Ordered special veg dum pulao. Rice was well cooked, didn't find lot of veggies though. Masala levels were good that adds spicyness. Can give it a try for 180+ bucks.",1

"Oh my God, what a horrible place. They have cordoned off small place in the corner and made that a bar. And in the name of making a bar all they have done is put some tables and very high volume speakers inside. They serve cocktails, but I would rather drink water than those cocktails. 4 of us, ordered 8 cocktails and two drinks. Cocktails including lit (a glass of Ice and very little juice, cost 650) sotb, (a glass of Ice with a little of some another juice) old fashion (even smaller glass of Ice with a slice of orange) and pinacolada( this I've no idea what they put for the white color, apart from that it was bad juice again). 3 of us were not even a slightest bit high.

All this said when asked for way to washroom you are directed outside to the mall washroom!

Again that being said, when the bill came it seemed a little strange to me (we had two zomato gold discounts) when asked why they have not included the highest price drink in the 2+2 discout the answer strangely was- ""because its the highest priced drink!!"" (did not even act as if it was the mistake accepted it square faced that it was a ruse to cheat your customer) when I implored further the waiter went inside and got it corrected!

During all this while the place is so loud and there is no place in the pub to even make the waiter understand of what we are saying to which we had to go out of the place to have that bill conversations, I guess that too is the part of the cheating plan.

Be aware people. Avoid this place.",0

Although the manager was sweet enough to get me another drink.",0

"Tried two places in same venue on Saturday evening. In Hyper Local first, Seated outdoor as inside is little loud to my taste at 6:30pm.Ordered drinks and snacks, spicy chicken wings very hot, average taste (3/5), chilly cheese toast-drab dry (3/5). Drinks front my friend ordered small rum since its happy hour got one plus one, I got my beer then as last order for happy hour ordered large vodka, after getting one when asked for plus one - reply is oh we assumed you asked us to make one large out of two small!!!!!!. Now OK I can forgive that its misunderstanding suddenly we get the check asking to pay up while still having our drinks. When told we have not asked for same and may be want to eat and drink more reply received is oh but we have policy after happy hour everyone has to pay and if required restart new billing.

People who made this place have spent money sadly should have visited good places around world to see its not only ambiance to nonsense music but food quality and service quality which makes reputation. Good bye for ever.",0
It is sorry to say that no side items like chutney or salads were served with the order this time but only one pack of curd and little chops of onion with the order of two 'single biriyani'. Truly disappointed.,1
"Chicken Biryani was awesome.
Service was good .
Toofan thankyou for your assistance.
Place and location is easy to locate.
Thankyou for the service , would love to recommend friends and family as well .",2
I had a very experience related to the hygiene of the place. We were in the balcony when we saw cat walk through the separation (it separates balcony from the bar). We told the person serving us and he said that the cat often comes here and does nothing. You don't have to worry about anything. Till that time we had ordered our food. But seeing the cat walk by and no one batting an eye we cancelled the order and walked out.,0
was good,1
was beautiful-peaceful and relaxing. Staff was outstanding. The restaurant was exceptional along with the hosts and servers. A must visit place,2

Good food and service Of quality very nice and ambience or hospitality are amazing the chicken Biriyani was amazing ni redo mission Justin muffin Butch Cassidy,2
I tried to visit the place and asked the waiters if we can use the 2+2 on drinks for non alcoholic drinks as well. The waiter informed us that it is not possible but if we want we can switch to 1+1 for starters. Then a new waiter came and upon ordering he informed us that this is impossible but what was even more frustrating was that he started speaking in Hindi despite the fact that it was obvious that we don‚Äôt speak Hindi. Of course we left immediately and don‚Äôt think that will ever come back.,0
"I've been to this place about two times and i really liked the ambience, interior will give you feels of london streets.
talking about food, only good thing was lasagna other than that we ordered veg Platter and lasagna rolls which were really bad in taste. dj was not too good",1
Briyani was good and so crispy Briyani was good and so crispy Briyani was good and so crispy Briyani was good and so crispy service is also good,2
We Ordered alphonso ice cream.. we got it with only 2-3 pieces of mango.... This is not expected from cream stone. As we r regular customer.,0
"This is a good place to hang out.The ambience is really good . One of the best chicken nachos I have had till date but the crispy chicken disappointed. They Do not have a big list of beers being brewed and the is not that great when compared with other brews in hyderabad.
Would recommend this place if you are someone who likes virgin pinnocolada",1
Good food with nice infrastructure.serving is good but need some fast. Food was very tasteful and satisfied with every thing in Paradise. Restuarant i,2
Quality was bad ...they just scoop ice cream,0
Great ambience and food but cocktails could have been better. I had pasta with white sauce and it was best i had in quite sometime. However i was disappointed with cocktail. I ordered LIIT but it was not as good as i expected.. but overall it was a good visit and i will Probably try something else next time.,1
Good food..egg friend rice was nice and also chicken Tikka masala was awesome. And service was great we enjoyed the food.. people's are very nice ..,2
"I have ordered nuts loaded ice cream and also dry fruit ice cream. Really both ice creams taste was worst. They have added more anjeer rather than other dry fruits.Really I didn't feel like I am eating ice cream because of anjeer. I never going to order ice cream from cream stone. People who wants ice cream taste don't go for cream stone dry fruit, nuts overloaded and Afghan ice cream.price also not reasonable.",0
I‚Äôm not a huge fan of buffet but I‚Äôve been here only to taste the dishes and they were great and had a variety. This place is for family get togethers. You‚Äôll enjoy the food by its taste and variety and you get food chocked love at the live counters. I‚Äôve been here a long time ago but I still remember my time here. I‚Äôm giving this only three stars only coz I‚Äôm not a fan of buffet.,1
"Nice food as always, briyani is great.
Nice to visit here.
Specially chicken tandoori. Thank you to Kunal for serving and helping with serving.",2
"Doesnt entertain ordered placed through food ordering apps. Had to wait for 45 mins before cancelling the order. I even talked to the cashier.
After assuring the order will be ready in sometime, there was no update.",0
Great ambience and decent brew beer. But there is something very elegant in terms of ambience. But food is on little disappointing. We order chicken starter and French Fry's both where disappointing. In terms of chicken starter I felt high ajino Moto,1
"Taste is good üòã
Service is good other then for restaurant and very helpful employees. Sweetdish is nice and also many varities in menu card for other than restaurant",2
"I did not have a good experience here. The service wasn't good. The ice cream looked good, but I didn't like the taste. Too many nuts. The listing in the menu was a bit misleading, and didn't have anything mentioned about nuts.",0
"Food is average, service is poor. Can get crowded. The ambience, especially interior and its seating could have been better. Though finger food is good, not much options for main course",1
This is my first visit gachibowli paradise i am very happy and biriyani very delicious and service also very good and all staff also very friends ly,2
"I am wondering if I had ordered thick shake or an ice cream.. thick shake will have better consistency than this.. most of my previous orders were in the same condition, yet I gave them 3 or 4 star considering the reputation of the brand .. NOT ANY MORE. Spending 150+ on something like this is utter waste.. IF YOU GUYS COULDN'T PROVIDE ICE CREAM IN PROPER WAY THEN PLEASE STOP GIVING HOME DELIVERY.. despite of the fact that there is hell lot of dry ice in the package the ice cream came was in that manner. I wonder if I can actually call this as an ice cream. Some times u guys forget to keep dry ice and sometimes the ice cream gets completely melted ..... NOT SATISFIED with your ice cream. . Not worth spending a single rupee on this one.

I was trying to take a pic and then this happened. I didn't keep pressure while holding. You can understand how liquid the consistency is just by looking at the picture. I didn't had a single spoon of ice cream from it and not a single drop of it fell out. Both quantity n quality was not good. I understand that ice cream melts but not at this rate. I place was less than a km away and delivery guy can reach in just 3 minutes. Despite of the distance and presence of dry ice, the ice cream melted completely.",0
"To spend a nice evening after Office hours, we visited this place and occupied a table in the open area of it.

The weather was nice and thus, we had a good conversation and laughter enjoying it.

In drinks, we had Hot toddy, Brewed beer, Fruit punch, Pinnacolada and many other mocktails. All of these were good but there was nothing special about them.

In food, we had masala omelette, loaded nachos, cottage cheese fingers, mushroom Tikka, fish and chicken wings.

Loaded nachos was the best dish among the list and we had two of them.

Overall, the place is nice but the food and drinks were okayish in comparison to the other places in town.",1
"A very nice place with a very humble staff. Quick service and a hospitable ambience. Very delicious food, probably the best biryanis in the country and the starters are no less either.",2
Look at the quantity of icecream charging 175 and the product should be worth to it right ......and the brownie is not at all backed its completed rock chilled,0
"One place i can visit over and over, just for ambiance.
Lasagne is a must try here..
One thing to keep in mind, they will take the last order 5 mins before it closes, and wont give time to eat will just close the lights and ask u to leave.",1
Nice Biryani. The taste was good but the quantity was less. The service was good and staff was curious. 1 biryani is sufficient for two people. Value for money,2
I am not happy the way it is managed. No proper response from the workers. My order was not yet prepared and these people are not ready to replace my 1 order out of 10+ items which I have orders . These people are not working for customer satisfaction. They are working for only money. Not at all happy this time.,0
Went with Collegues for lunch...Good Food.. ..but not so great ambience... Staff is not pleasing at all. There were only bothered about taking plates off the table.,1
Paradise is one my favourite restaurants to eat briyani once in a while .... It's good with the service and as well the food .... Too yummy ... Tasty too ....,2
"Ordered Fruit exotica and fruit and nuts ice-cream on two different days, once from swiggy and once from zomato. The ice-creams were both melted and lacked the flavour and quality that is usually offered by cream stone. Highy DISAPPOINTED!! I was a fan of cream stone ice-creams but I won't recommend this to anyone ever again. Not worth spending money on.",0
"A very mediocre experience to be honest at the outset. üôà

I have been to the same restaurant in other cities and had great expectations.
The ambience is delightful and the three stars are only attributed to that! It has a rooftop setting and a nice band was performing live!
Coming to food and service, I would rate it 1/5. We tried the jalape√±o cheese poppers, horrible taste- so much so we had to leave some of it. We had the vegetarian pizza- served burnt at the base! On asking for a replacement the waiter says it might take a while to prepare a new one. Only the lasagne was slightly upto the mark. The service was literally horrible, being a Sunday everyone was just chilling on their own I guess ü§£ü§™

I would recommend you to try out other places and save a large pocket pinch by avoiding this place.",1
"Chicken Biryani is excellent one of the best Hyderabadi and Service is perfect, will visit again
Ambience is good and staff is very polite. Best place for a family outing",2
"Ordered fruit exotica and I don't know what the hell is this ice cream but sure it's not what I ordered , not the experience what I wanted but that was indeed a surprise",0
"A grand entry, decent ambience and average food. That just about sums it up for 10 Downing Street.
Just as the name suggests, the place has a very British feel to it as far as the ambience goes. It's cost, warm and has great layout. But the layout proves to be a negative as well. We went here for lunch and the place was very loud. The good point was that we got a great seat with excellent view. The service was decent but one of the dishes we ordered did not arrive. I hope they write down what was ordered.
The food itself was good. We had chicken wings, chicken Tikka, seekh kabab, tandoori veg platter and drinks. The food was good and arrived a tad slow. Overall, it is a good place to have a drink and be merry.",1
Good service and all food very good taste......Biryani super looking and my family is very happy thank u so much so come for again paradise gachibowli.,2
Taste was pathetic....I didn't like it.... Roadside ice cream would be better than this.,0
"Ooo the 10D...
Again, brewed beers... Lovely. Food... Good. Music...can be better.
Very nice ambience. Rooftop setup is oh so lovely..

A bit heavy on pockets. Service is good until the clock ticks 11. I felt, the staff were a bit too in a hurry to get everything closed down and to get lights off which is a turn off. So, folks , get your beers by 10:55 üòÇ",1
Good food and ambience good servise staff was good and food and servise both are good i had veg biriyani its relly good come again and again,2
"It was great but,the standards have lowered. My choco lava was like Stone and ice cream was like cream!!! Anusha has done the worst jobü§ê
I now don't prefer this place.There are much better places where people at least listen when you say how your ice cream is looking.",0
"This outlet located on 10th floor of SLN terminus, is our team dinner venue.rlRestaurant had a decent ambience, but open top can have some more mild lighting. Brewery is available. But as we booked a buffet in bulk , we got limited options for food and alcohol

Food has got 2 veg plus 4 non veg appetisers.
Main course was very limited. Biryani's and gravy each one for veg and non veg. Tandoori rotis and nans. Desserts were very limited. Vanilla ice cream and gulab jamun.

Alcohol has 4 options. Bacardi white rum, antiquity whisky, Smirnoff vodka and kf beer.
Mocktails, cool drinks,soda and fruit juice available for Mixing. Loud music with Divine drinks on breezy Roof top is definitely worth a try.",1
"Chiken musallam was really good and in dat we had keema also ...nice flavour..loved it .next time definently i would like to come with my family.
Toofan served us and he is really amazing guy...lovely person..nice to meet him.",2
quantity was less,0
"Didn't like the ambience. Also what's the point of giving drinks in plastic cups to girls, do you want to make them feel bad that they are getting free drinks. Overall not a very good experience.",1
"Experienced the best haleem here. Murg Musalam taste was good. Service was awesome, they were too respectable. Good ambiance. I recommend to my family and friends.",2

Nyc restaurant.. should come and taste haleem .. even veg is sooo good .. there is scope of imporvement.. good management and staff is also good ..,2
Poor Service. Have ordered ice cream and it took 1 hour to reach me..by the time when it reached it's not like ice cream it's like milk shake... completely melted. They didn't add solid ice inside the package at all.. too pathetic online delivery service by creamstone gachibowli branch... Never expected this from them because am a big fan of creamstone...it disappointed me badly by it's poor service,0
"Ordered Special Mashad Haleem,it tasted good and was topped with Kaju, Almonds, Pistachios and fried onions. It's a must try over here.
Special Mashad Haleem: 4/5

Had also tried veg manchuria, chicken biryani, double ka meetha, murg malai kabab.
Chicken biryani was average. Not a big fan of this.
Veg manchuria was ok.
Murg malai kabab was good, should definitely try this one
Double ka meetha was ok",1
"It's is very tasty and very good for health,haleem is very yummy.And the atmosphere is also very good loved the place better to try this place.",2
"Ordered nutella brownie and got brownie and vanilla ice cream It's a shame that they write the name of the ice cream correct, take the money correct but FAIL TO MAKE the ice cream correct. Not expected from cream stone. Your customers are not fools. Dont insult them by assuming that they are less intelligent.",0
"Average food for cheap cost,better we can go for only for grilled chicken and tandoori not so for Biryani and the quantity was too good for less cost",1
"Very tasty, specially biryani we are satisfied , service is very good, I suggest you come can try it had a great time here had a good sense of humour to the staff",2
Please look at the below image. This is how I got my order when I order from zomato. I had a confusion to eat it or gulp it. However I gave 2 * for the browny,0
Biryani taste is awesome and delivery also on time but sometimes when I order I get worst Biryani..it looks like I got someone's leftover Biryani...,1
"Here is one of the best buffet places for team lunch in Gachibowli area. This colourful place is so hospitable that you will just go muahhhh...

Ambience is quite good and has optimum free space. This place seems to be set up for team lunches only üòÇ. The menu present is splendid and too many items are there that you won't be able to taste each and every item(I don't even remember all the names!!!!

Starters are mouth watering (as I write), may it be veg or non veg. To begin, start with chaat counter which has a conveyor belt with plates arranged on it, this section includes sushi, golgappa, aamras shot, etc. This is self served so stop being lazy and go satiate your mouth watering taste buds!!

Delicious Starters are served on your table. The one of the attraction is the pizza oven!! You can be your own chef and try making a pizza of your choice and yeah you also get a Master Chef Certificate üòõ( Hoping you may use it in your resume). Main course also has some delicacies worth trying. I am not naming any because I was having foodgasm that I hardly cared to read names.

Desserts ahhahahhhaa!!!
You have good number of options of pastries and ice creams and indian sweets. I had gulaab jamun, halwa, pastries and Pan Ice cream(which is highly praised here)!!!

The ice creams are instantly prepared using liquid nitrogen and is a treat to watch. You will also find hot jalebis and etc etc etc.

Only drawback is that during high incoming rush, staff is in a hurry and you can't have much leisure time!!!

I would suggest go and give it a try with your team or gang... I believe that you won't regret trying this fabulous place!!!

Section wise Ratings:

Ambience: 3.5/5
Staff: 3.5/5
Food: 4/5
Buffet items: 4.5/5
Overall: 4/5",2
not ggod,0
Biriyani taste is good but got 75 percentage of full spicy biriyani that too it was like one rice part is attached with another rice part with help of masala.... So please mention special request clearly in the comment session while ordering(example:need little spicy biriyani)..,1
Starters were very tastiest. Good place to choose and the ambience is amazing. I especially loved it. Sourav ismial had served us with pleasure.,2
ice cream was melted before it reached me and I didn't see dry ice pieces in it either service was too bad,0
Avg biryani. Can be a lot better. Ordered tadoori chicken as well and that is ordinary as well. There are much better places to go with in this place,1
"Best Restaurant with great food, Satyajit & Team was fabulous....Must visit place...Starters are good...Need to improve in desserts especially icecreams.",2
"Ice cream was good , but it's totally got melt as delivery boy took a lot of time to reach. He mentioned it as delivered as soon as he picked order. He took nearly 45 minutes to come.",0

An waiter refused to take any tip!!!",2

Satyajeet, Alok, Jayanth.. Team are excellent",2

Too too much spicy, was not able to eat it without water.

If you cant cook properly better dont sell it.",0
"Heard a lot of time about this place and always wanted to visit but couldn't so though of ordering food online.

Ordered vegetable briyani which is good in taste. Expected little more but it was good. The delivery time was also very fast.",1
Awesome food. Mr Sabir ambience is really nice. Everything about flechazo forces to visit this place again. Kudos. This is my fourth visit. Always it is improving.,2
Been there for couple of times hoping that they will improve in terms of quality and service but honestly if you really want to eat some dumplings mix with 2or 3 pices of potatoes or paneer or whatever then go there and I bet you you will curse yourself later the funniest thing is that they don‚Äôt even know how to make a proper paratha or kulcha they are just making fool to everyone on the name of ‚ÄúNorth Indian Food‚Äù instead search for another joints in Madhapur or Gachibowli like ‚ÄúParathas and more‚Äù or ‚Äújust paratha‚Äù there you will get the real authentic food.,0
"I had ordered grilled chicken from pakwaan grand, firstly it wasn't grilled but it was cooked. It was juciy and tender but it was not grilled. The spicness was mild and light. I had tasted their Biryani which was little strong on spiciness but grilled chicken was nothing compared to it.",1
"Sabir-Service is extremely good. He is very courteous and fantastic. Nice ambience and super starters.. Awesome food overall.
Recommends this restaurant.. Please try out",2
Dropped down my expectations. Ordered aloo tikki which was worst and palak chat which ended up delivering dhahi chat. That tasted sweet. I regret ordering.,0
Dal makhani and kadhai mushroom both were okayish.Mushroom pieces could have been more.Packaging was nice.Delivery was a lot late though.Overall moderate experience:),1
This place Is very nice food was awasome guys are very good.we are visiting flehazo restaurant that's lovely place.i think this place is very good place.,2
Have been eating in Sardarji's from a long time but now I feel they have lost the taste in their food. Nothing is good not even chat. Will have to look out for another option in Hyderabad for good chat.,0
"I have been to this place earlier. Didn't like the ambience.
This time i ordered mini chicken Biryani from food panda for 66 rs. It is totally worth the money spent.
Taste was good. Chicken would have been bit tender.

It was lot better than its famous neighbour

Taste - good
Ambience- bad",1
It was my birthday and I had a wonderful first experience. Jayant accompanied us with all the best starters both veg and non veg and made us very comfortable. Me and my wife had a wonderful lunch on my special day. Loved the place and foood is awesome ‚ò∫Ô∏èüòç,2
"In plain simple words overhyped. Very greasy and oily and bland taste. Order chole bhatire, mix veg kulcha, daal makhani and aloo tikki. Everything was very poor in taste. Better to put some effort and visit Bikanerwala in jubilee hills.",0
Ordered from online at 57/- only... The taste is good. Nice biryani with long grain rice. Better than paradise for sure. The chicken was not big but good....,1
Services jayanta are wonderful. Starters are very good to start with mango flavour prawns adds classic mango taste. Wish pizza is also good for different pizza lovers. Overall a fantastic experience.,2
"Maybe all these 4 and 5 star reviews are paid ones. Ordered aloo paratha... First of all quality of the food is bad. Bad odour from raita and then instead of sending pickle, they sent something where I can only see mirchis but no pickle.",0
"Didn't visit this place, but tried the Haleem of this place... Well not that good... Bit it's OK... Its worth a try... You can definitely try this place once...",1

This place lacks consistency. Everytime I go there I have different experience. Sometimes I had amazing Biryani with prompt service and sometimes a disappointing one. The biryani was consistent majority of times. One of my go to place for biryani,1
I have given my b'day treat to my friends. Guys! It's an awesome place to dine. Their Starters are so good to have. We had great time with Jayant.,2

OK not,1

Jayanta service was very good and food was on time. Thanks to them .",2
I received wrong order..i tried to contact with restaurant but they didn‚Äôt received the call...this is the worst experience ever i ordered online,0
"Ordered dal makkhani rice multiple times. Panner paratha is good. Quantity is less for one person. Even the large size is only served as small to medium size.

Packaging is nice although not separate. Food can't be stored, supposed to be eaten as and when ordered as both dal and rice are packed together. 

Food seems hygienic. Need to work on quantity for different size meals as it is not enough.",1
"Flechazo brings together two culinary regions of the the world- The Mediterranean and Asian. It has a minimalistic ambiance with maximised seating which serves as an ideal place for celebration or office gatherings.

Food shots on the conveyor belt has got an amazing response from the customers dining in. Gol Gappas, kachoris and the chaat options are a fun factor that makes up for the DIY concept to the table.

Starters: Stuffed Mushroom is a good option and Veg tempura is well balanced in its spice content.
Main course: You will have a whale of time picking out options in biryani, rice and curries. Leave some space for the pasta though.
Dessert: This section gives a whole new meaning to the term ""spoilt for choice"".

This place is indeed a foodie's delight.",2
We ordered samsa chola kulcha chola and sandwichs The taste quality is too much low I did not eat this type of quality food from different restaurant...worst taste and worst quality I ever had .....,0
I would recommend this place for ordering purpose. The food is good in taste but being you may not find that healthy. Good north indian food.,1
"Visited on 12 may 2019, for lunch with family. Awesome food, comfortable seating, soothing ambience. Booked table through Zomato and received confirmation in 3 minutes!!

Went in early at 11.30am (brunch!). Welcome drink, soup and starters served at the table.. they have a mango festival till end of the month so most of the dishes have mango in them, super delicious.

Apart from the buffet spread, they have live counters for pizza, pasta, chaats (Pani Puri yummm...), sushi, keema kulcha and few others one bite snacks.. starters are aplenty; veg and non veg.. the servers are attentive and helpful.

Desserts was a mix of Indian sweets, pasteries, cheesecakes, fruits, and their speciality liquid nitrogen ice-cream, fun to watch though I am not sure if healthy..

I was surprised with a Mother's Day cake, complements of the restaurant.. that was a wow gesture.. a must visit place for celebrations or whenever you are hungry for variety and lots of food!!",2
roti nd nan both u gave me without butter nd i ordered with butter...nd both are burnt. even paneer curry quantity was too less man..no1 can eat a single chapathi with that...nd panner pieces were in burnt condition.,0
"A small place nearby gachibowli circle.

"They will accept your order even if they don't have the items. After 40 mins they say they don't have it and doesnt cancel it. And Delivery boy will also mark your order as delivered. In short words , go for dine in or choose different good apps to order .",0
The overall taste is good and I recommend Paneer Thali which is both reasonable and yummy. But if you order paranthas then the North Indian taste that a parantha has is little missing. Overall combos are good and Thali's too are nice option to go for.,1
"Love dis place...
Good in terms of ambience,food & hospitality


Live pizza & smokey ice cream are best...

Highlight was dance steps by the staff for birthday celebrations...",2
"Too bad service, does not accept the Order multiple times & does not receive Calls too. And the best part, they cancel the Orders after money gets deducted. Very bad experience, I mean WORST Experience.",0
The food was prepared quickly and was also delivered on time. However the salt in both the dishes ordered was very high hence faced difficulties in eating. Please balance the spices in order to not to spoil the food.,1

tasteless dal makhani... eating kulcha with it made it tasteless too!,0
"Amazing taste. Ordered Chole, Paneer dish and almost all the Naans. Quantity is also good compared to the price. Lassi and Milk Thandai were not so good. But the most important thing why I wouldn't rate it high is it's self service policy. The place is too small and even water isn't served. Not even tissue papers.",1
"Good place to hang out with friends , the panipuri on the conveyer belt and making your own pizza are the main highlights for this place....",2
yesterday there was leakage of water pipe(possibly drainage pipe)at restaurant .... instead of repairing that they are shamelessly kept counter open .... customer had to stand in line while water is leaking beside and at the same time eat beside that water leaking pipeline .... I would suggest first repair pipe line and then open restaurant....... serving in this condition to customers shows no value of customers,0
"Visited with family for dinner on a special occasion.
The valet parking was a relief.
Unfortunately there was no maitre'd and we had to seat ourselves.
The ambience was great - I loved the light colours and bright lighting as it put a positive spin on the evening.

The food was really good. The sushi (even the veg variant) was worth trying and the starters and ravioli was superb.

Service however was lacking on all parameters. It was cold and inefficient. It was a real struggle to get the attention of waiters and when we finally did, they seemed perpetually annoyed and unwilling to help us out (couple of women in particular - could not catch their names). The billing too took an unreasonable amount of time.

The food here is great, but the low service standards compelled me to restrict the rating to 3. Quite unfortunate since this place has the potential to be a great restaurant.

Will we return? Perhaps not in the near future - the only reason we would return at some point would be Zomato Gold on the food.",1
An decent buffet ranging from your own customised pizza to the amazing starters. The place was crowdy even on a week day. Servers and chefs taking personalised comments on food delivered was very satisfying. But the finger food on conveyor belt was cold. The pizza needs flavour and tom yum soup is real disappointment. Couldn‚Äôt get to main course but the spread seemed interesting. Would love to visit again.,2
Ordered bhel puri from this place and I found an ant in while I was eating. These guys are unhygienic and dont take necessary precautions to ensure that they protect the food they prepare from all the insects around the area. Be careful!,0
"Went for lunch with friends...ala carte. Liked the ambience,though it was really far to get to!! We had the Caesar salad, which was fresh and could have used a bit more seasoning; Pizza arabiata-really nice, crust thin and ingredients fresh and tasty! Penne pasta-chicken was also good, though the chicken seemed dry. The best dish was Thai green curry vegetables which was served with a jasmine rice-the best ever flavours-a must try!! Now coming to the desserts- we had the philadelphia cheese cake baked-nice plating but cheesecake can be improved significantly. Creme brule was good--loved the crispy carmelized sugar crust.
There was a lot of crowd and it took us a long time to get our orders. Overall it was a nice experience, hope to have a better one next time.",1
"Place was good for starters and mocktails.
Shabir was handy in service.
Pasta was to the top notch
Prawns were good.
Deserts are love. Must try their mini gulab jamun",2
"If you dont want to deliver the food then dont accept the orders in the first place and the cancellation call from zomato comes when you expect your food. Be careful while accepting the orders or at least dont make  the hungry people wait even to know about the cancellations 

Giving 1 star bcoz cant rate below that",0
"I have visited Jonathan's kitchen on many occasions. One thing that strikes me is for such a big restaurant, their service is not so nice. Also, they denied us Zomato gold services saying we were sitting in Komatose, however as per their front staff, they told us to sit in Komatose as they didn't have seat in Jonathan's kitchen but the food, menu and staff will all be from Jonathan's. Hence we sat and ordered and later, found out, no gold accepted.
I have tried their buffet, ala cart, Sushi and everything else, Nothing extraordinary. The only benefit is, it is close to my place.",1
"one of the best place in terms of hospitality, food and ambience. 
Everything was superb.

Staters 5/5
ambience 5/5
main course 5/5
desserts 5/5

best of the buffet is their live counter pizza and smoky ice cream.

It has to be in ur list definitely.",2
"Worst daal makhani, i have ever tasted in my life, kinda weird taste it was.
Minus rating is not there otherwise i would definitely have punched that.",0
"This was my second trip here, after a long gap in between. Overall fine experience. Service is good. We ordered the Prawn Sushi and Jambalaya. The taste of the food is good. Liked the sushi, though found the pieces a little too big. The jambalaya was good in taste and presentation. Overall, good ambience with decent food. Liked the ambience and service better than the food.",1
"4 stars:
Pros:
1.variety of starters
2.option to make pizza,pasta by your own hands
3.good biryani in main course(a rareity now a days!!!)
4.atleast 8 items in desert(the jalebi was specifically good)
5.staff behaviour

Cons:
1.only one soft-drink avialiable,for every day one flavour,so if you are unlucky u have to drink orange juice if you go on tuesday even if u dont like it
2.no hard drinks available

Overall a very nice experience, go and enjoy!!!",2
The delivery guy didn't return the change. He said he ll be getting change in 5 mins and he disappeared.,0
"Lousy staff and lousy service. I went for dinner buffet and except a few things I didn't like anything. The deserts were really really bad. With so many options and none of them were good.
The only good thing is the ambience. I don't recommend this place at all.",1
"I absolutely loved this place. Let me begin how comfortable this place is. The sitting is comfortable and the arrangement here is handy. We were served with welcome drinks. Few starters were also placed on a small conveyer belt in a corner which consisted of , chat and fish. later actual starters were served to us on our place. For a non vegetarian prawns and all kinds chicken is a must try. For vegetarian chilly paneer, crispy corn, chilly fries. Here you can make your own pizza as well which helped us to gain some more space for the meal later. The Mediterranean pasta is better than the white one. Later we hurried for lunch because the sweets were waiting. The food was also good. In sweets the gulabjamun with badam kulfi and jalebi with rabdi was good. Even try pan ice cream.
The staff here is courteous and friendly as well.
Overall you can enjoy a happy, long, fun lunch or dinner with your friends/family/colleagues.",2
"If there was an option of putting up 0 stars, I wouldn't have hesitated. Look at the kind of food they offer. I had ordered this 'Aloo Kulcha Combo' from this restaurant. A burnt kulcha, and not even a bowlful of Dal was served. The combo mentioned pickle as well, but that wasn't sent either. Despite complaining them with requisite proofs, no action was taken. TERRIBLE!",0
"I visited this place for a Lunch Buffet recently.

They have wide spread of Starters, Main Course, Veg- Pizza+Pasta on table and huge variety of Deserts.

Food taste was Ok, but nothing different.

They have only butter naan and tandoori roti.",1
Loved the food here especially baby potato in harissa and sweet chilli barbeque prawn is must try in starters and smoked paan ice is just wow. Mini pizza and pasta is also good here.Thankew Sabir for your awesome service and helping us pick d best one. Had a good dining üòÄ,2
I order a veg biryani. It was cold when it reached me. The taste was just bland and they had 1/4th of the biryani filled with half cooked beans. Even the cauliflower was not cooked properly. They should just remove the biryani from their menu forever.,0
"This was on my list since few months and finally we went for a Sunday buffet.
Ambience is good with cool music and performance.
Service ok.
Food not satisfied.
My review is only on vegetarian food.
Starters:
There were 5 veg starters. 2 paneer, crispy corn, cheese poppers and mixed veg. Crispy corn was disappointing and others were good.
Live counter:
Dosa was OK and Gobi paratha was good.
Main course:
I couldn't taste noodles as the dish was not refilled even after waiting for sometime.
All the gravy items were OK.
Deserts:
The dishes were Mysore Pak, kaaja, banana in hot jaggery liquid, kaju burfi, one type of laddu, apple crunch, answer kalakand.
Kaju burfi had more sugar and others were ok. When I called to the restaurant they said that they will have approximately how 100 items but I couldn't find even 40 vegetarian items there. I booked buffet in dineout offer. So, it was good deal for me. In general, I felt 1300 for buffet with this spread and taste is expensive.",1
"Nice place to visit beautiful ambiance and the service Jayanth, Hasihul and Kushal is awesome,
Finally the taste wonderful we are very happy..",2
Had the worst experience ever. Having ordered Paneer Butter Masala and getting Mix Veg paranthas was not at all expected. So guys be prepared if you get a totally different dish than what you order online.,0
"After having dinner buffet here, really wonder hiw come thia place has this rating. Food, service, ambiance...nothing stood out for me. Met friends here for dinner and wasn't impressed. Food is ok, spread is average. Service is good , but thats expected, not exceptional. Most disappointing was the setup. Very average, considering its a above average priced and a hotel restaurant.
Easily avoidable.",1
Liked the starters and service jayanta kusul hasebul so good ggggggghhhggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhgggggggggggg,2
"Heard a lot about this small food joint and the north indian stuff they make. Should say I‚Äôm disappointed, looks like the quality is not the same as before, even the price is a bit high compared to other places with similar taste.",0
"This was one of those places on my list that I have been wanting to try for the longest time that I can remember. I specifically wanted to try out the Sushi (Veg) in this place. I remember reading that it was one of the really sought out places for Japanese cuisine once but now has almost everything available. In any case, I ordered a stater (shanghai rolls) which was average and finally went ahead and ordered Sushi for myself & wife and a pizza for my daughter. The sushi was good but not as good as the one I had tried at Mamagoto (my fav place for asian cuisine). The pizza was better than the sushi but still would not say at par with some of the other authentic Italian restaurants in the city. I also tried their creme brulee (best of the lot) which was really nice except for the tangy fruits that they put as a topping. In my opinion, they ought to get rid of those toppings and keep it simple as it was quite delicious by itself. I would have rated it 3.5 but for their really slow service (and zomato has for some reason gotten rid of decimal ratings). 

All in all, an average place to try out. I might go back to try some of their other items on the menu. 

Ambiance: 3/5
Food: 3.5/5
Service: 2.5/5",1
"I loved the food variety. You will get a lot of variety in snacks here. All are lip smacking I bet. The best thing I liked this place is the people serving here. You'll get to experience that personal touch. With every course of meal they take your feedback on how did you like the food, any changes they can make to improve. You can also come here to celebrate your special occasions, they provide cake and also play music for you. We had Mr. Jayanta as our host. He was super humble and served nicely. A big yes for this place!!!",2
They have reduced the quantity a lot!!!!!,0
"Ambience is good and food is not that great. We visited the place at 1PM and food is cold and doesn't seem to be good. Compared to the cost, you can prefer flechazo/1983 dhaba/AB's.",1
Services is so good jayanta hasebul kusul has so good gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggjhhghhhhghhgghhghhhgghhggghhhghhggghhgggggggffgghgg,2
"Food quality is good. But not so many items, like crabs, octopus, kofta are available , particularly in this branch which are available at other branches of BN or ABs. So, it was really disappointing.

Also service was a bit slow, we really had to wait for items to come on our table in between. That really turns off our mood though the waiters are jolly n try to make us feel good. I think the number of waiters are less.

AC facility was good, very cold.

But I don‚Äôt recommend this place.",0
I had recently been to Jonathan's Kitchen based on the Zomato rating and was very disappointed. The food is average in quality. The service is also quite average for the price what they charge. Not going to visit anytime in the future,1
"This is one place that provides a very good buffet for the price that you pay. The quality of food is great. They maintain a variety of items across each course.
The fish served as a part of starters was the best I had eaten in a very long time.
Mutton kheema with masala kulcha also deserves a special mention.
The service is good and the staff is courteous too.
But sadly, despite giving clear instructions about the celebrations we had planned at the end, they had messed up with making the arrangement for 2 cakes which they had agreed to provide. This was disappointing and could have been avoided.",2
"Had a worst experience today at BarbQ Nation , gachhibowli, hyderabad

Taste is not as good as remaining branches. Non veg items seem to be frozen few days back then coocked, feels like a was while eating",0
"Jonathan's Kitchen is there at the ground floor or Holiday gift Inn Express and Suites.

Ambiance is pretty amazing so is the live music of here. But the food is not as great as you expect from such restaurants.Desserts are good and there is also a quite descent range in it.",1
"Soothing Ambience, admirable hospitality by shabir and buffet was delicious in every section,perfect place for family, friends and office colleagues.",2
"This is the worst barbeque , i have ever seen in my life. Barbeque for name sake. No barbeque item like paneer, fish was baked properly. waste of money",0
"Sooo... It's a sports bar. On the side of a busy road , so easily accessible. Very lit... Bright.. a bit too bright for my taste though.
I went on a special day , so there was a live music band playing. But it was too loud. So the brightness and the loud music didn't do justice to so much as setting the mood.

Food was ok, taste wise. But price was on the higher side. Limited variety of food. But they have done some nice experiments with the wings. So , try worthy.

But there are very nice people working there. Very friendly, Nice staff. Service was very good.

Along with that, if the ambiance would be set for proper occasion, then what a hit a road side sports bar would be..!!

Hope to visit again soon.. to a nice ambience üòä",1
Very good taste and lot of items. Excellent service. Jayanta hasubul kusul gggggggghhhhhhhhhgggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg,2
"We were here to give our treat to a group of friends. What started out with cold barbeque, bad grills turned out to worst. The grill was replaced and hot starters were served so the point of the grill was totally made redundant. As soon as we pointed out that the service was slow and the starters weren't coming quickly, we dint know what we were calling for. The waiters visited our table every 2-3 mins to enquire if everything is alright now. I am not exaggerating when I say that they came to me at least 20-25 times in the next one hour to let them know that they are doing good. I did not dare to say that they weren't still good with the service and starters we were asking were not coming. They almost forced us to say they were excellent as apparently the rating for them was important even if it meant disturbing us every odd minute and spoiling the whole meal. Finally I was forced to give them an excellent rating as the man stood next to me till I did that. Feedback is to improve and not to be used as a tool torture. The food was nevertheless mediocre except the mutton sheek kabab and chicken pepper soup which was good. Barbeque nation, please don't pay your folks based on our ratings if you are doing that coz it's extremely irritating being answerable every minute. Btw, this was my second experience of feedback taken wrong but the first one was not as bad.",0
"Food - 3
Service - 3.5
Ambience - 3

The Chicken wings are the best here. We tried Chicken burger and Artichoke dip as well and it was just average. Chicken Patty in chicken burger was dry and not fresh. The Lemon slush was just iced sugar water with few drops of artificial flavor. Overall an okay experience.",1
"Pleasant experience - good food and excellent service. Courteous staff - Jayanta and Kusal, hasibul Gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg",2
Good place for team lunch but has pathetic veg starters option(potato and mashroom) but they tell will smile that this is all for today .I am writing this review whole I am in the restraint itself.improve Barbeque..every customer is important.,0
tutty frooty icecream is not good,1
Good Service...Hygenic Food...JAYANTA....KUSHAL...HASEBUL GGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGYGGGYGGYYYYGGGGGGGGGGHH,2
"I almost forgot to write the review as I got too busy until I found these pictures in my gallery. I was here for a lunch with my colleagues last month. What a bad day it was. When you have already been to the place and have a nice set of expectations from the food. First of all, the presence of foreign particles in food questions the level of hygiene inside the kitchen. I was probably too lucky that day to have two such instances. I politely asked to replace the drink that was served. But things got too much for me when I found a hair in the crispy corn. When I put this into light to the serving staff, they just tried to take away the plate and all I got to listen was they will replace it. That‚Äôs what drove me mad. When I demanded to see the manager, he apologized and asked for the plate replacement. But I was done with the food now. No more nonsense. At the end, the manager showed up with a specially made choco-vanilla dessert(in pic).
Not just the hygiene, but the service was bad too. The team was all the time waiting for them to get the food. The overall experience was bad, something not expected from a BBQ Nation.",0
please provide spoons with ice cream,1
Food is quite awesome. Service provided by jayanta and kushal hasubul were quite good. Ggggggggggggggggggggghghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh,2
"Food quality has degraded than before.
Ice tea served was more proportion of water . Ice tea flavour was not there at all. Partha served over the counter was pathetic. It was having very bad quality of oil not even ghee. Very much upset with the food quality this time.",0
"Amul brand is good for milk but not for ice creams.
They tried too hard to fit in but could not match the creaminess of other brands.
Coming to the outlet they hardly have 5 varieties ... sadly had to choose one among them.",1
Ambience is awesome especially Faijul service is good and friendly :) it is a good place for team outing.. overall we had a good experience and fun,2
"Visited it along with my friends for lunch today..
Most of the staters were served was of same taste n less grilled.Fish n chicken n prawn everything tastes same.After repetative reminder also they served the same.Also there is not much varieties are available for stater.Main course is ok.Deserts are pathetic.They are serving it for namesake..It's a horrible experience overall",0
too sweet!,1
"I visited Flechazo today with my family. The ambiance is very pleasant. The service provided by Ranjit and Ramjan was excellent. Food was nice we have several options for starters, especially I liked fish starters very much. Main course is also very good. Coming to desserts I love the Ice cream they made on the spot. This provides several food options in all starters, main and desserts. One the best place to try with family.",2
"I visited today . To be honest it's waste of money .... Everything that they serve tastes the same ... There is no variety of tastes... Fish and chicken almost tastes similar... It's like they have put the same spices on Fish .. chicken , mushroom and prawns.. Deserts are simply the worst.... It's like just name sake they are serving ...
For those who want to taste something good.. it's not recommended.",0
he packaging needs to be improved,1
Good Food and Friendly staff..Mehrul & Sourab have been best . Best Buffet in town. Fish in starters and Rabdi in desserts are to be tasted must.,2
"Service was pathetic. Ordered a sizzler with lamb, was told no lamb. Ordered another sizzle with Noodles. It took 15 mins to serve that one. Also, served it with rice instead and when I asked to change, they gave me a noodle differently and that too since they were irritated with lots of chilli sauce. I sweated through first 5 mins and then just left the sizzler as such.

No apologies, nothing from there side. When asked for manager, told me he is not here.

Prakash was not helpful or apologetic, he just denied that he never served it.
Benjamin still was apologetic about the whole goofup.",0
less quantity,1
"very polite service done by shabir, starters Korean tossed chicken, oriental Devilled prawns were excellent. Veg flexhazo style crispy corn is good too",2
"I ordered a chicken American chopsey, and they gave me this. There was no noodles in it nor soup. The dish was more of a chicken salad. Wrong order delivered.",0
"I have been to this place with my friends on a Friday evening as they had Bollywood night starting from 8.
The food was average. They didn't even had Breezer which is disappointing. The service was not that great.
As mentioned earlier, They has Bollywood night which didn't even start till 10pm.
Finally,
Food - 2.5
Ambience - 3
Service - 3
Menu and pricing - 3",1
"Very mild and refreshing taste. Best for starters and deserts. Thanks to Ramzan, Ranjit and Pritam for helping out with the dishes and continued follow up with the taste of the dishes.",2
"I went here earlier some time back and was really impressed. Loved the sizzlers.. so I recommended it for a team lunch. They preferred buffet, so instead of going for different kinds of sizzlers, we went ahead with the buffet. The most disappointing part was , despite a reservation for 12:30 pm, nothing was served till 12:55.
No body even looked at the table, as they did not want to even respond. We can accept a delay but negligence is not acceptable. We had to go back to them and ask for water and keep inquiring when the food would be ready.
Finally they served and none of us liked the food. All they could relish was coke and gulab jamun.
Even if the food was not good, I would not give such rating. But the service is very disappointing.
If If there is an issue, we would be glad to understand the reason for delay. But being rude and ignoring when we are at a restaurant was least expected.
Don‚Äôt think I would go back there again.",0
"I visited this place on Friday, but I don‚Äôt like food and service provided. I ordered barbecue chicken but it was not cooked properly but I liked the ambiance and open terrace.",1
"The food was amazing with good ambiance, the staff was very friendly, totally worth the visit. especially Ranjit and pritam we're too good at their job and concerned about their costumers. Visiting here again when in gachibowli.",2
"I‚Äôm sorry but this isn‚Äôt the right place for online orders. I did not get my complete order and what I received was also not what I had ordered for! And nothing was done, apart from receiving Z credits, because that is only what zomato can do!
Check your orders before you send it to the customer.",0
This place is awesome to hangout with friends. I liked the dance floor and the way they serve the food and been polite with customer. But food was average need to improve in that a little.,1
"Went with a group of 9 people for buffet. The place had nice ambience and excellent food .@Hamid and @kushal‚Äôs service was impressive, they even danced with us. It was a really fun experience.",2
"How do you expect me to be nice when the food I ordered when I am literally hungry came spoiled and the Zomato support people are not of any help.
I need my money back.",0
"Again I was in dilemma between 3 to 4, place is good and nice terrace. But it's very very small. The night will purely depends on band playing that night. All regular options of menu available. Food is OK and nothing special with drinks but a good evening can be passed through.
OK kind of for your money as I am comparing other places in same area",1
Food is awesome here. Had a lot of fun with friends and the service (hamit and koshal) is really good. Starters and desserts are very good here. Ambience is also good.,2
They delivered a stale food at night when ordered from zomato. I paid INR 400 for stale food and when i tried calling restaurant had closed. No one helped,0
"Had peri peri chicken and dragon chicken starters.... Taste is OK.... Peri peri chicken served with fries but not spicy and dragon chicken is spicy and sweet sauce mixed....
With zomato Gold had a good experience...

Management and waiters are good in service becoz we went in weekday so didn't had any problems.... One best thing to watch cricket on screen on terrace....
At last had a great time with friends...",1
Wonderful service and food. Great care by Hamid and kaushal at the table. Enjoyed birthday celebration of my friend. Pizza making experienceüëå,2
Worst place to have a sizzler. Tried hyderabadi sizzler which was just rotten chicken biriyani on a hot plate. The noodles in the veg sizzler were very bad as well. These guys dont know how to make a sizzler. The staff was also not well trained.,0
"DJ floor is the best part of Skyhy üíÉ
The name of the lounge is justified with a decent rooftop.
IPL and T20 times are the best to visit this place
Although the food and drinks quality need to be improved on a little as we had bad experiences for couple of visits",1
excellent service by shabir... Starters were very good. especially the oriental devilled prawns. the Ambience of the place was lovely. staff were very polite. overall experience 5/5,2
Vegetables are not cooked properly waste of money,0
"I had been to this place last weekend with family. I must say the service is excellent. Coming to the ambience, the dance floor and the area beside that looks great, but the rooftop wasn't that interesting. 1 less star only for that. But other than that the food was good but not that great. We ordered:
1. Budweiser (3)
2. Virgin Mojito (2) - It was soooooo good.
3. Chicken Tikka - Could have cooked more.
4. Crispy chicken Asian Style
5. Dragon Chicken
6. Chicken pulao - Same as Biryani nothing great

Overall, I feel a little more work to be put into deco on the rooftop & a little on food. But a good open air experience. Best if you come as a couple. The dance floor will be open to you.",1
"This place serves buffet for lunch..It is a value for money dine restaurant.Although they claim to be a Mediterranean resto,most of the items served were that of Indian..So , don't go by its name.The service is really good and the chef personally asks your preference and feedback. The complimentary starter can be improved..One thing I liked here is the option for vegetarians.Veg starters were plenty ,be it be live counter or the ones served at table.Cajun potato,corn , pineapple,paneer ,kebab are to name a few.All were good.They serve MOMO ,pasta,pizza too in the counters.
Main course was nice too and had good variety of curries.
Dessert spread was huge . Overall ,a good place.Hope they maintain the same variety at the same cost.",2
Food was not that great for the price range that they have!! Disappointed!! Service was also not that great! Had to call the waiter at least 4 times for them to serve the food!!,0
Came for office party.. food is just okay.. they have dance floor also.. ambiance is okay not very great.. maybe top floor have better ambiance.. overall ok ok place..,1
Service is excellent. Fodd tasted very nice. Ranjit and romjan served to the best. They are polite and friendly. Will visit agian. Ambience is excellent.,2
"Place is pretty good and the food is decent but the service is really pathetic even not in the busy hours, it takes 20 minute to take your order.",0
"Pub was superb...rooftop, great ambiance, good music , dance floor but food was ok..most of the popular drinks was not available ‚òπÔ∏è.. overall goodüòä",1
"Sabir kusal and jaki...Service was excellent , Starter , especially Veg was delicious. We had a great experience with live counters. Desserts were mouthwatering. Overall we we're happy with the atmosphere",2
"I have order veg sizzler but and they served me the non veg sizzler. I had it without knowing it. The server was rude, unpolite and refused to accept his mistakes and even manager to the same extent. There is no proper communication between chef and server. It was worst experience in my life as I am a pure vegeterian. I would recommend not to visit this place. I would choose negative rating as a best option.",0
"Nice place with an awesome ambience.
Delicious food and customizations are considered.
Service must be improved as I didn't found any one to guide or receive when I entered (12:30pm)",1
"Mr Anup and his team have done a wonderful job and it means a lot to us for celebrating birthday and the best dishes for delivering. We will happy to come here again.

Thank u guys for your humbleness towards customer.",2
"Went to this for an office lunch, the time taken to get the food out is unbelievably high. On top of this a vegetarian colleague was told that the food is vegetarian and got served chicken instead. Never coming back!",0
Ambience in here is nice it's my go get hangout place and sure about food it's good .. good for casual and team especially when there is a match coz it's got a big screen with open roof top space.,1
"Went here for lunch, it's bit different than usual bbq buffets starters were impressive, service was good. You will get wood fire pizza here, due to heavy crowd when I went the pizza was not baked properly. They can improve in dessert section. Rest all are good and different than regular buffets.",2
"We had a very bad experience here. We have ordered Fish Shashilk and Sizzling Chicken sizzlers. The Fish Shashilk sizzler didn't have fish in it. Upon asking the waiter, he started searching the fish in my sizzler and was trying to make sure that I had already not eaten it. He then brought a grilled fish fillet and said that the sizzler can't be remade because the kitchen was quite busy. Upon arguing, another person came and changed my sizzler. I had visited this restaurant with lots of expectations as sizzlers are one of my favorites. Mistakes can happen anytime anywhere. It's an urge from side that please behave properly with the customers.

I would have given one star. But one extra star for the person who bothered to bring me a new sizzler.",0
I been to this with my office colleagues. Everything's seems perfect expect the DJ in this bar. They need to improve on this asap. Drinks are little expensive,1
"Starters are very good ...on the whole it was delicious and sumptuous buffet... service is really good, especially from one Mr.Jayanta. hasubul",2
Worst food and service.. After long waiting we got the food.. We ordered starters and sizzler.. They prepared the food and forgot I think.. This is the first I have seen a place with starters in cold stage... Been to this place for more than 10 times and never had complaints on food. But today is nightmare.. Worst food and their best item is chicken shashlik sizzler which is worst today.. Bye bye Absolute..,0
"Food is horrible , cost( both bar and food ) are too costly and the taste of food don't justify the price.but ambiance is okay , music is nice . Good place for drinking but food ! Ah ah no",1
"Had great fun with kids, family exceptional hospitality especially Ranjit.Good variety food.worth place to have buffet with family.priced good",2
Not worth visiting. Waited for a very long time about half an hour. People who know what a sizzler is will not like it for sure. I think restaurant name should be changed as they have buffet and other indian food in the menu.,0
"been here couple of times on weekdays, it has both open area and closed area too the ambience was nice. the quality of food is ok ok...DJ was good. The service was fine but you are not valued if you are going as a stag... After spending some time felt its too cold outside so asked if I can go to closed area but they refused even after requesting which made me to leave the place earlier.

Food:4/5
Ambience:4.5/5
Music:4.5/5
Service:3/5",1
Avinash and Apurna was very corteous to serve and the place was friendly with the chef coming to make sure that they are able to serve something different on your plate and make your experience worth while.,2
"Had a bad experience today in Absolute sizzler. Chicken served in the sizzler is half cooked and we left the chicken without eating. Soft Drink served is not chilled its room temperature. The person who served soft drink has not informed us that the drink is not available in chilled temperature, staright way he served it and then informed us that it is no chilled . Overall experience is very bad.",0
"Place is nice , it has open area on terrace and closed area too. Have been here twice and found that the service is nice but the quality of food is not that great. DJ was good. And once out of 2 times, have experienced power cut and the team was not able to have the backup for 30mins. But this might be a one off case so should be fine. Its an average place to be there.",1
Had good experience here with a new concept of serving food and making your own pizza. Service from Mr.Avinash is superb and overwhelmed to have been attended who served us food till we were full and content.,2
"Hi,
I have ordered 3 Hyderabad Dum Biryani costing Rs 300/- per biryani, In total Rs 900/-.
Quantity is very less and with no quality. All Mutton pieces are waste peaces.
I called up Hotel to inform the same but they are not responding.
Poor service and poor quality.
Only 1 person can eat Rs 300/- biryani . Very Upset.",0
"Non veg wasn‚Äôt good at all. Ordered fish, chicken wings, both were vry bad.
Veg was good though, ordered chilly mushroom and crispy corn. Chill mushroom ws exceptionally good",1
Nice ambience . Tasty food. Excellent serice by Romjan and Ranjith. My daughter enjoyed making her own pizza and other stalls also good. Thanks.,2
I'd give a better review if the food was at least doable. The place lacks ambience and there were a lot of minor inconveniences due to communication problems.,0
"The best hangouts place with friends and girlfriend and it had good dance floor. I got good variety of liquor brands also but the food is main concern in terms of both taste and quantity.for quires contact sujith_reddy12 in instagram

"Great experience! GREAT SERVICE AND FOOD!
AUP SANJIT JAKIRUL WERE EXCELLENT AT SERVICE!
There are some exotic food that is a must try thing at flechazo like prawn orange shots",2
"Bad food, bad ambience, bad service, clueless waiters and expensive food. Such a waste of money. Everything was bad. I regret going to this place.",0
Food was mediocre and had to wait an hour just to get the starters. A rooftop devoid of a view . Only good thing about the place was the dance floor .,1
"The service is excellent ,special thanks for ranjith and ramjan awsome ,again i just wat to visit again and again thank you alll ,great service",2
"The place serves below average food. The place is supposed to specialize in sizzlers, but that didn't taste good either. To add up, the waiters were totally clueless. Utter waste of money!",0
"Good for group outings. They provide rooftop seating arrangements.
Music can be better for the dance floor. Ambience is okay. Food is average. Good staff though. They are helpful and friendly.",1
"Very nice food and an excellent service! Had a great time here! Highly recommend for parties!
Anup, Arumay and Zakir - thanks guys for a great service!",2
This is the worst pasta i have ever had....pasta is sweet and dry and not even cutlery oregani or chillifslkes are provided never order......,0
Been here on a Saturday evening. The service looked a bit slow but the food tasted good. They allow stags without any cover charge but they don‚Äôt let you enter the dance floor if you‚Äôre one. The staff is also very co-operative. Go here as a crowd and you would love it.,1
"Great place and wonderful hospitality. We were served by Ranjit and Ramzan and they are truly sincere and great hosts. Food is good, a must visit!",2
"We went for lunch and ordered two sizzlers, veg and non veg. Both were not up to the mark. Taste was not good and portion size was less. Not enough veggies in the dish. But one good thing I liked the ambience. Need to improve loads on the taste part",0
"5 of us had been to dis place on 27th night, good place, decent set up, food is good, DJ is good, parking,lift area poor,conjusted weekends.",1
"This is just great place. The variety of veg starters are great and value add on is pizza and pasta. The sushi in starters were for the first time I had and this is great. Jayant and Purna were great host. Hasebul, the captain, takes care of everyone very well. üòÅüòÅ",2
"Had a lot of expectations when I read the ne for the first time. Was able to visit it after a month.
What a disappointment it was. It's named sizzler but has nothing close to sizzler. You guys really need to work on the art of making sizzler. It looks like sizzler. It only looks",0
"Was there for dinner on a weekday. The ambience is sombre. They have a wide variety of menu ranging from European to Chinese to Hyderabadi biryanis. Tried the Virgin guava Mary mocktail,which was really good. The chicken quesadillas were delicious. We also had spicy chicken sizzlers which was also good. Had an overall good experience.",1
"Prawns here are really tasty, even veg kekab crispy corn and all other starts are tasty. Even I liked main course especially egg masala ... Service provided by Jayanth is hasubul purno plesant ... Overall nice place to freakout...and celebrate ur memorable occasions.. thanks to flechazo...",2
low quality and quantity,0
"We came at this restaurant for a drink on a weekday at it didn‚Äôt disappoint. Music was good. We ordered a Pizza, Garlic Bread and Beers. Pizza was the best I‚Äôve ever had, but Garlic Bread was disappointing. Also, we had a couple of Beers and we ordered a couple more. They were unopened, we changed our mind and asked the waiter to exchange them with Coke which was refused. I didn‚Äôt understand the waiter‚Äôs logic and I didn‚Äôt argue. Also, apart from Beer everything is costly here. I‚Äôm going for a 3 out 5 for this restaurant.
PS: This restaurant serves the best Pizza in Hyderabad.",1
"Had wonderful food and good ambience..specially loved the dance by staff...great hospitality..three cheers...Romjana and Ranjith are great ppl..they know how to treat Thier customers well .. excellent job keep it up.,..Hena Rasthapuram",2
food was less.,0
"Delicious food and decent crowd! Roof top was unbearable because of heat so had to shift inside. Since music was bit louder inside, bought some whiskey and went home. Overall okayshh.",1
"I feel veg starters shud be improvised, we had mushroom, sweetcorn( which were very dry), kebab ( not properly cooked) n few others starters. They are not that tasty n didnot make a wow impact. Fish starter was awesome, prawn should be cooked more, chicken tikka was ok. Overall not convinced much with taste of starters. Maincourse was far better than starters and desserts were also ok. Can definitely visit but not with huge expectations on taste.",2
Chicken is not boiled or fried. Its all raw,0
"Good place to go around
Ambience is good and crowd is good over weekends
Food was not that good which i thought of
Must try jalepeno cheese poppers
Ambience 4/5
Food-3/5
Seevice -3.5/5",1
It was a great experience coming here for the first time. Mr. Sabir has served us really well. Would suggest Everyone to visit here at least once.,2
"I have had high expectations of food there but then my green salad with mint sauce was not very good. While the chicken wings I ordered were nice, but they ruined the American Chopsuey. It was more like eating a soupy noodles than a Chopsuey. I wish they would have made that better.
Ambience was good, staff were okay.",0
Overrated.... I don't know why stag entry is not allowed there... No crowd... Okay okay ambience..... Service is slow..... And if you are using zomato gold they will say that they don't have Kingfisher premium... Kingfisher ultra and draught beer.,1
"Food has always been good in Flechazo. Good varieties of starters with unlimited serves. Smoking cold ice cream is a must have experience.

What makes Flechazo is their friendliness and service. Celebrated my son‚Äôs and wife‚Äôs birthdays here, was so much fun with friends.

Special thanks to their team, Jayanta, Hasibul and many for making this such a pleasant experience.

Love coming to this place again and again and again !",2
"This is what we were served today when we ordered for Grilled Paneer. I think this was someone's left over which we were served. Giving the benefit of doubt that they might have made some mistake, I informed them that it might be a mistake but the manager said that they didn't have enough plated to serve and hence they served it like this. After a lot of arguments they finally decided to change it. BUT the story does not end here. They served us ice cold paneer in a different plate. I will just finish my beer and leave now.",0
"I went on a ladies night. They have really good cocktails. Food is good, but i felt the quantity was less. Ambience and music is good . Service is good.",1
Ranjit and romjan are excellent..Food and service is very excellent. Ambience and place decorations are very good. You can find varity of dishes at one place.,2
"Worst service experienced ever.
Nobody is concerned about even taking the order.
its just waste of our evening.
Not as expected.
This review is completely for the Service we received.",0
"Tiki shack near jubilee check post was one of my favorites and that's the graar vibe it carries, gachhibowli one is never like that but undoubtedly a good place to hang on. LIT will have a special mention in both the places though.
Little costly and ya inside they would have some restrictions with stags and couple
Your wallet would feel happy if you are going as couple or gang",1
"This is one of the best places in Hyderabad if your planning for a buffet. The staff is very courteous and ensure that you are not unattended. Apart from the indian cuisine main course, food was yumm. Jalebi was the show stopper. A must visit!!",2
"Apparently that's their garnish. Oh yeah, the orange peel on the plate. Was my drink the dustbin? Lol üòÖ. Oh wait, I guess maybe I never had a cocktail. That's what the waiter said. Horrible service. The guy wasn't ready to even call the manager.",0
No dance floor and dj was not such good . Need to improve dj system and good players to be placed and no stock in alcohol what ever we wish to oder sorry not available.,1
"Excellent place, food was very good and the service is great. The person who served us, Ranjit was really attentive and helpful. Overall the experience is easily worth the price..",2
"This place is stupid and extremely discriminating . As a guy you are not allowed to enter the dance floor . The bouncers are hostile and say that unless you have a girl , you cannot enter the dance floor . I understand there might be instances of guys Misbehaving but the attitude of the management towards people is extremely hostile . I'm never coming here",0
"My friends and I went here on a Friday night around 8:30 and the place was pretty full and had good music interesting interiors  and overall great vibe.
The service was a little slow, but quite understandable given the crowd that kept pouring in till late in the night

Food that we ordered - 
1. MASALA PEEENAT  - your normal peanuts with onions tomatoes and some spices. Decent munching

2. MASALA LIJJAT - this is masala papad with the same toppings as above, so we didn't quite enjoy it that much

3. BHEJ MANCHURIAN - Veg dry manchurian balls which were amazing!

4. JALAPENO CHEESE POPPERS - Unlike other jalapeno cheese poppers i've tasted elsewhere, these weren't very dry and bland. Also, good accompanying dip

5. ALOO PAKODE - aloo bhajiyas! Loved them! :D

6.  FRIES - good old classic salted fries! :)

The DJ played some really great songs! 
Had a great time, especially when they played the Bollywood music and most people were on their feet!",1
"Anup, Ayuv & Rajesh are really good. Liked the hospitality. Came for team dinner and really had a good experience. One of the best places to have buffet",2
"The Lady Bouncer Aunty with glasses at the desk didn't allow us to go inside as we were wearing Slides. She referred the slides as 'Slippers' straight to our faces. They should've mentioned about 'Shoes' in Zomato app. I feel so sad about the half knowledge of the aunty at the Reception desk. Will never visit this place, Ever.",0
"The quality of food and drink was really good. What turned out to be the biggest let-down was the service. A few of the waiters are really ignorant. They look for bigger groups to serve and circle around them only. With much effort we got a waiter to come and take our order. After waiting for half an hour, we enquired only to find out that the waiter had not put in the order at all. We got a new waiter to whom we had to re-iterate the whole thing. Although the new waiter was really polite and helpful, but our experience was already ruined. So my humble request is, if you don't like to serve a smaller group, mention it outside and we will definitely avoid your restaurant.",1
"The service was very good. The place was very lively and kudos to Anup, Preetham and Ranjit for their service. The speed was also too good with pan ice cream stealing the show. I would recommend this place with thumbs up.",2
"They always deny the table on weekends or Friday even though we book on Zomato or other apps due to high demand, this is not fair if we did a pre booking",0
"Amazing indoor and outdoor place to chill. Music is amazing... go for safe choice of food selection, which you are aware of... I visit here all the time for music! Cool crowd. Gotta improve over food and cocktails! Drinks otherwise is good (options)! Two stars less coz they gotta improve over food!",1

"Went here on a Thursday, the staff were really pathetic in service and no Zomato Gold etc were eligible. They could have responded in a proper way when asked why it's not valid. (since it's ladies night)",0
"Not that much great place, reason being the service is very slow. No one comes to take the order. Located in a great business area with all the big companies. The place has energy and good vibe but service is something that needs to be worked on. They have started serving different vapes at this place which costs around 700-800/-. Thats something cool you get in different flavours. Food is fine.

Cheers Rakshita Nath",1
"Great ambience.
Good food.
Service is polite and friendly.
Ranjan ,Raveendra and Karthik are very friendly to the customers.

More variety of non veg items are available.

Would like to visit again.",2
"Bunch of hypocrites. One cannot enter unless they have a girl beside them. One cannot enter unless they have shoes tied to their feet. One cannot enter unless their lower limbs are fully covered (for guys). We pay you to get us drunk,not to judge us based on our footwear and whom we tag along. You think someone without shoes can't behave or pay you the bill? Pathetic stereotypes.",0
"Visited this place on a Saturday evening cause I've heard a lot about Tiki Shack. The ambience was pretty decent and has a beautiful roof top view. But, I was honestly surprised that the food wasn't that great and infact I thought it was bad enough for all that I've heard from people.

Ordered non veg nachos and I hardly found any non veg in it. The pizza was quite bland too. One of the really bad pepporoni pizza I've had in my life.

Food: 3/5. (3 cause of service and the nice people there)",1
"Sabir was great, he was very cheerful and is hardworking guy he made sure that we try each and every dish in the menu and also tweeted a lot of dishes according to our taste and preference. Had a lovely dinner experience with Flechazo.",2
"Service was way too slow. We had to wait 40 minutes for a single dish. The drinks menu (on the app) is good but they never have enough stock so don't even bother going here for drinks. Single guys are not allowed on the dance floor. BBQ chicken wings was putrid. Worst of all? Look at the picture I attached, they cheat you by giving you smaller shot glasses when you're very drunk. Horrible experience.",0
"Ambience - 4
Music - 4 
Staff - 3 
Drinks - 3 
Food - 4
Hit on wallet - medium
A super-hit club of Jubilee Hills, as per me, is finding hard to live up to its reputation.

Standard Cocktails can be made better. In food, Nachoz is good but don't expect too much non-veg in non-veg nachos - feels more like veg. Achari murg is good and so is garlic bread. 

Music is good and sometimes they bring in Dhol wala to up the spirit

Cheers!",1
"I just loved this place , service is too good...I was served by Sabir who was so good for his service üòä fully satisfied with food and service",2
"We are the regular for this pub from beginning.Today we have visited this place , waiting more than 30 minutes for our order to place .They are being in confusion to take the order. I felt like we are treated like beggars and there is no proper grooming with staff . I didn‚Äôt saw proper response paid for a customer . As usual the food is good. Dj was good with nice songs.This time the overall experience was totally badüòñüò°üò¨‚òπÔ∏è",0
"Been to this place few days back with my friends

Ambience was quite good -4/5

Service was okay -3.5/5

Food was average - 3.5/5

We had ordered 3 non veg starters and 3 veg starters. There weren‚Äôt many good options for veg starters and something veg that we ordered were just average at taste. And moreover that day there were only starters and main course was not available. When it comes to music this was the best part. The day we visited there was bhangra music. Apart form Bhangra the dj was good was playing mostly bollywood music. Overall if you want good bollywood music with not so great food you can surely try this place",1
"Great Service by Sabir. Thanks a lot man. The food was great, the service was impeccable. Keep up the good work. Gonna keep coming back. This place is awesome",2
Horrible experience. Wouldn't want to come here ever again. Horrible food. Horrible service. Extremely disappointed with the entire package.,0
"This place closes by 12 and the food is is quantity but it closes earlier then expected, what should be done in this case. It shares wrong information.",1
"Sabir, we were really pleased with your service . wonderful place to visit, good ambience, perfect place to hangout with friends. Prawns fry is very delicious.",2
Lal street management didn't allow us . Zomato doesn't mention stags are not allowed here in the app. I went there and came back. Is it a girl required to enter lal street? crazy,0
"I went here to celebrate my birthday.....
If you go to Mustang, you should sit on the terrace otherwise it isn't worth it.

The place has good service too, the servers are helpful.",1
Sabir's service was excellent and he has taken keen interest in serving us the best and the chicken starters were too tasty. The red velvet cake was drooling and so good.,2
"We are here on Thursday night and place was empty at the time we reached but they says every table is reserved , so we found a place finally and ordered Maggi pizza which took them 40 minutes to serve by that time we loose our appetite !! Even customer service is late ! Food was good but they did not accept dine out pay !",0
I am giving 3 star out of 5 to mustang just for roof top ambience where i was able to drink in between the glowing city lights ... Restaurant should work on customer service more ...,1
Great service by ranjit and ramjam...good ambience and a great place for family. The desserts are amazing and the sea food was lit. Affordale price,2
Bad customer service! First we booked table near screen still they didn't give and they make people stand near screen! How the hell should we watch the match? People go to see match and they do this!,0
This pub is located at the heart of the hi-tech city. It's a rooftop bar with a pleasant view. Nothing very extraordinary about the place. Food is about average. Mostly the office crowd keeps pouring in. Live streams the ipl match in big screen. It mostly remains crowded and yes the music is bollywood,1
The service and ambience here is great! Jayanta hasubul atm were very customer obsessed. Starters for both veg and non veg are good. For kids too they provide balloons and a small toy to play with üòÉ. I definitely recommend this place. The ice cream taste should be improved.,2
"Although we booked our table, the suitable table couldnt be found for us. One guy passed to another one and we sat outside. After this they send inside. Finally the table was found for us.
We ordered J√§germeister and Baileys but we had nuts for the prices 375 and 450 (see the portion).
Ok I understand that prices are fluctuates, but we didn't know that we paid for this little shots. These drinks serves with proper glass with ices, BIGGER PORTIONS, THIS IS CHARGING.
Will never visit this place again!",0
"Great selection of drinks, but most of the options on the menu were not actually available, which was a bit disappointing. The limited options that were available including pizzas and burritos were very good.",1
Excellent Service provided by Anup and Ranjit. Food is also very good. One must try their Stuffed Tandoori Mushroom and Oriental Sweet Chilly Chicken.,2
one of the worst service ever I recieved today. I don't wana refer anyone to this place. I contacted the lal street they told me about the happy hours menu and after going there tha menu has been totally changed i. e. from 1+1 to 99 and i didnt like this and worst ever service,0
"Food, drinks and music all is good. What this place lacks is in service. The servers literally forgot us and we had to call them multiple times and remind them to take our orders. The ambience is great. The view is superb. They have 3 sitting areas, indoor and two terrace sitting.",1
"One of the best buffet experiences we had in Hyderabad. The food, especially the starters and desserts were out of the world. The ambience and experience is unique. The staff is very courteous and made us feel like we were at our family home! Would like to call out Shabbir for the gracious hospitality. Must visit if you are in Hyderabad.",2
"This was our second stop in same complex on Saturday (30/03) evening. Only reason I am giving two stars instead of zero is the rescue of situation by GM of the joint, given below so you guys decide the merits of place.

Went for outdoor sitting at 7:30pm, suddenly one server comes up start arguing we can not sit on table with 5 or 6 chairs as we are only two, this is when all of 40+ tables are empty and we are first to arrive for outdoor sitting, he goes on to argue with us to such extent we started to walk out when at exit we met GM of place who asked why we are walking out given our reason, he was quite apologitic forced to come back in, owner of the place (forgot his name) who was listening to our conversation also came in to apologize. Anyways out of respect for two gentlemen we had one drink each with peanuts and left in 40min.
At 8:15 only 3 tables including our was occupied in outdoor.... Hence the futility of all the hoopla.",0
"Great ambience. It is very windy when you sit at the top most table and it has great view. Service is average and food is also average. Went there on friday in a group of 10 people. We ordered many dishes but the quality was average. Since we were sitting at the top service was also average.
Ambience 4/5
Food - 2.5/5
Service 3/5
Overall 3/5",1
"One of the best restaurants in town, they have got the best food and staff specially SABIR.
The ambiance is great, and the variety of food they have is awesome. Must try for chicken wings, corn fry, mushrooms, pizza, & varieties of deserts.
They have got live counters for pizza, pani puri & liquid nitrogen ice cream which is one of its kind in the city rit now.
Visited this place for a friends birthday, the complimentary cake & Dance was awesome.",2
"Went to this place it is a nice place but customer service is not good, they accepted my table booking but later when I visit the place they did not allot me table u just have to hit the bar counter.

Note to manager- if u can't provide table just don't accept it.",0
"The ambience is good but please check the bill before paying. They charge 10% service charge without asking you which is illegal. Please do not pay service charge, ask them to remove it if you find it on the bill. Thanks.",1
"Starters are not so bad
Pan ice cream is good
Please provide good entertainment
Food shots are okay
Hospitality is so good from jayanta, haasubul.",2
"Ambience was good.
But food, in taste and quality, was not up to the mark.
Also the service was poor. Waiters were not waiting properly, you had to call everytime for small things like glasses or plates.",0
"The place I have visited many times made me sad by the last visit. Because most of the tables they kept on reserved, though during staying there till 10.30pm, we have not seen anyone to come and occupy the seats. The starters items are extremely costly and very less in quantity. Only reason of visiting the place is roof top. Otherwise it is one of the most expensive places to visit in Gachibowli area.",1
"If u r looking for a peaceful place with a good service for birthday celebrations or any kind of celebrations like anniversary etc...ur search ends here ...this place have buffet which is superb with a reasonable price ...i just love the ambiance of this place and decors ...the service they give is 5 out Of 5 star ..i would like to mention uh #SABIR for ur POLITE AND HUMBLE service with a beautiful smile from the starting of session to the end ...u will be lucky if SABIR serves on ur table...we've visited this place for our friends birthday to surprise her...the way they wish the birthday person is superb ‚ù§...we had starters which was all good..here u must try prawns,wings,fried fish which is a must ...
In main course was nice ..coming to the desserts we had gulab jamun,halwa ,jalebi(which was served hot from live counter),macarons was not bad , i dont like that brownie,pastry,sandwich was too hard ...in the end the best thing i liked there was "" smokin' cold icecream"" which is also a must try..overall we had good time here...looking forward to come again !! ..",2
"The waiter here. Specially manager srini is worst and rude person here. Suggest never go to this place , they treat people as they are getting food for free.",0
"Yes... Mustang is a great lounge..just went in the late evening... Just want to kill some time there that all.. Used zomato gold.. They do accept it.. Well and they dont have Fosters and Kf Premium are not available we order KF ultra and a while later he bought Budweiser.. As the idea is to kill time so we just had the beer what we've they given.

Service : 3
Rest all u can mark as 4.",1
"Great ambience and lovely food....
Eating festival for food lovers like me....üòã
Service is excellent .... Brothers Hamid, Sanjit and Jakirul have taken good care of us....
Our baby enjoyed special status on spiceless food n painting playing time",2
"Place was a complete let down. Was there for lunch on Sunday and was disappointed. The veg stack in the western section was actually a spicy paneer which was basically spicy filling between 2 slices of paneer and topped with a chilli sauce. 2 dishes took 40 mins to come while 1 was served in 12 mins. Staff were lost and seemed to be recovering from a late night on Saturday. The only saving grace were the drinks. So unless you want to go and just have a drink and then more drinks, skip the place.",0
Decent place. Food is good. Music is average. Staff are polite and service is good. Not an pub compared to the term pub. No dedicated dance floor.,1
"Haleem, the best place to try out.
Avaialble in all multiple outlets.
Haleem, usually found in the Ramdan season, months of march to July served by Shah ghouse and badam kheer are must try",2
"They need an improvement in veg barbecues, many choices in non veg but very low choices in veg, today we visited the restaurant with our 60 team members, out of which 10 to 12 members were vegetarians",0
"Went on a Friday evening just because I was in the Gachibowli side. Tried the cheese balls and the bell pepper onion pizza. The food was decent, did not have any drinks, so can't comment on that and the ambience was okay. But service is what made me really frustrated with the place. Hence the three star.",1
"Ordered Chicken Fried rice. Very good; however, didn't give curry with it. Not sure whether they forgot. But did like the taste of the variety.",2
"Been here after seeing the rating but somehow disappointed. Starters was okay. Main coourse was very limited, i mean like common fr 700+ bucks dey provide less items. Dessert was good. Mexican fried icecrm was smething i tried fr d first tym but again the menu was limited and the quality of the cakes and pastries was very bad. My frnds nd me too could sense a foul smell as if it was nt fresh. Coming to the special items duck, rabbit squid, quail was on live and the chef cooked all the items in same way in same sauce. So i couldn't just feel the difference between all those special to be dishes. The place is nt properly built as i could smell the smoke of cooking and burning as well. Staff were very courteous and polite. Special mention to lassi and my favrte aam Panna was lit.",0
"With an impressive location, it could have been one of the prime spots but the placement of items seems unimaginative. The ambiance created with the light bulbs is utterly ruined with a large screen in the middle of the room. The sound system needs improvement with focus on more than just base. 

The food is good and it was worth the wait in this decrepit atmosphere.

The outdoor seats are not as comfortable and there is no measure to tackle scenarios of rain.

It is a decent place to just have food but expect nothing more",1
Wonderful place with good food taste i like the way they prepare the food. There i like they serve to us and the way they maintain the restaurant clean,2
No words very very very bad service I ever had. I wish this outlet would close forever. Staff??? Oh yeah staff they don't give a fuck to any customer. Because its a brand its KFC guys. Common no guys its KFC so one cares about review in zomato. Fuck this outlet.,0

"Visited with family for dinner on a weekday. Decent place, may be a little more lighting will add to the decor; pretty cozy though. The staff specially Akash needs to be applauded, very enthusiastic and customer focused. The starters were good, very spicy but he got us a fresh set mildly spiced even without we making a request. We were not happy with the main course spread, only 1 curry (chicken n paneer). Good place to hang out with friends for a cocktail and some delicious starters.",1
"Nice taste of Biryani, and the price was also fair, ambience was good.went with my team they loved it..starters were excellent with crisp and spices",2
"I had bad experiences at this place multiple times. The management has no sense of customer experience. The people working there dont even respond to customers properly. While ordering, they don't check the inventory. We had to wait for 30 min for order to be served and even after that, there were some items missing. When asked how long it would take, they just responded vaguely. Iam not planning on visiting this place ever again.",0
"So much hype for a sub par biryani. Ordered paneer biryani, taste did not live upto the hype. The taste was bland, could have been better. Any local biryani place has much better biryani at a lower price.",1
Used to hear that this was probably the best place to have haleem in the city. To my dismay I ordered their renowned haleem last night at about 12PM. Tastewise it seemed average but as I was hungry I finished it fast. Fell asleep at 2AM to wake up at 5AM with a severe upset stomach. This went on and when I woke up by 10AM my stomach still hurt. I'm pretty sure it was some form of mild food poisoning maybe due to hygiene  standards. Nonetheless if they keep this up they'll gradually lose their clientele. Would recommend a place called Cafe 555. Their haleem is far tastier and doesn't come with the complimentary food poisoning.,2
Service is very slow. Took more than 15 minutes to prepare the order and still the food was cold. KFC quality has also gone down. Chicken was just okayish. Even AC is not working at the restaurant in peak summer time.,0
Ordered the much hyped about Behrouz biriyani today.Wanted to have it since ages.So today when the package came I was really thrilled.The biriyani comes in a stunning package.And as you open it the room fills with amazing Biriyani smells.The biriyani was looks good with a lot of almonds and greens as garnishing on top.The biriyani comes with raita and a gulab jamun too.The biriyani is quite different from the other popular biriyani in Hyderabad.This one is extremely sutle in taste.The chicken was tender and was breaking apart easily. The rice grains were staying apart and was expertly cooked.Overall the biriyani was a really good experience.But I personally prefer the spicy type when it comes to Biriyani but this biriyani is different and it is mouth wateringly delicious in a completely different way.,1
Best Hyderabad biryani. If you are visiting Hyderabad and you are a non vegetarian you must visit this place and taste the authentic hyderabadi biryani.,2
"I have ordered zinger box meal, the chicken inside is raw for the piece and the burger. I Don't recommend that this KFC is hygiene in cooking.",0
"The biryani experience started well. Having said that, it's not as good as earlier experience now. Two simple issues: chicken biryani has no chicken and dry fruits have disappeared. Should bring them back?",1
"I just went for the biryani, and it didn‚Äôt disappoint. We ordered the special chicken biryani. It was spicy and tasty and seemed proper Hyderabadi. One dish enough for two people easily. Decent service as well.
Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4.5/5
Service - 4/5
Cost - 4/5",2
"Don't know what is going wrong with KFC as a brand , they are doing it wrong in every aspect! No proper management of customers on the counters, the food they are serving is not upto the mark as it used to be. I was a fan of KFC, but slowly I am loosing interest in going. I had a very bad experience. The coke they served was very sweet without any soda in it , I though I was having a sweet water. The chicken was not served hot. The quality of the rice they are providing is going down day by day!

Management please look into this, or else you will be loosing a lot of patrons. It's high time to think!",0
"I ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murg Biriyani. After seeing the Royal Box of Biriyani, I was really happy. Whole packaging of raita and Gulab Jamun was upto the mark and really good. But then the taste, it tastes sweet. Everything was good from packaging to the Mouth freshner they gave but I didnt like the taste of biriyani.The quantity was good, and was garnished with almonds and cashew.",1
"It‚Äôs a fact that the entire hyderabad waits for Ramadan just so that they can have haleem and no place better to do that than the king of haleems; shah ghouse.
Tip: ask the person to get you a no added oil haleem and trust me, it tastes much better. We also have the habit of adding pathar ka gosht on top to make it taste even more delicious.",2
"on March 20th 2019, I've ordered 3 8 piece Smoky Grilled, which is worth of 1,857 rupees through Zomato. Instead of getting three 3 8 piece order, i was only given 2 8 piece order and 1 Hot crispy. I've called the customer care and i was assured call back. But, they didnt. when i've approached Zomato, i was told that there is nothing that they can do about it. Here is the twist of the tale -   instead of refund or replacement, i was only given 150 ruppes zomato credits. I would really not recommend orders from this place, as the customer treatment is pathetic. Since this is a corporate order, i strongly recommend my Food committee not to order anything from KFC in bulk.",0
"The only biryani which tasted a little sweet to me. Sometimes when u order curd rice and expect nothing fancy but you see some garnishing with pomegranate and then you have mixed feelings. Coz the dish looks pretty but..... Similarly, the packaging is great and garnished with nuts and looks very rich. But at the end wasn't satisfying.",1
"Always the best... The taste of the biryani is so unique that I can close my eyes, taste the biryani and tell that it's Shah Ghouse Biryani....

I deducted one point for the behaviour, which could have been better. Not pointing towards any specific scenario but I would prefer ordering online from Shah Ghouse than going there and eating, specially when I am late.

The quality sets it apart from its competition. It is guaranteed that you will get the same excellent quality of food everytime ...

I judge a restaurant by its consistency and Shah Ghouse is indeed the most consistent restaurant in terms of food quality.",2
"worst service and i have spoke to the franchise owner and i know him in Hyderabad he told me. he can't do business with high quality ingredients, please don't go to KFC restaurant",0
It is just average coming to taste. You dont feeI that lavishness as you feel from the hoardings and all. I have ordered from swiggy and quantity is not sufficient for 1person. At this price better we can pick many options. Better dont take it.,1
I had shawarma so many times in so many places but no one can prepare like him it was so tasty and price was also okay and they always respect the customer instructions,2
I ordered rice chicken porpcorn mealbox.. They only gave me the rice box no popcorn... Very bad experience.. I trusted this place.. I am very disappointedüòë,0
"I have ordered two box's of Chicken Biryani the chicken piece were too less, not what I was expecting for the amount I have spent  on a so called Royal Biryani... hope the feedback is taken positively and acted upon",1
"The place to have one of the best Biryani‚Äôs in hyderabad. Chicken and mutton biryani are both awesome. The food is hygenic and well cooked. Chicken 65 and chicken biryani are a must try. Veg starters are also taste worthy and relished at time.

Cheers Rakshita Nath",2
"I don't understand if they don't want to deliver why kfc shows as available.
Everytime I place order most of the time it get declined after payment. I am not worried about refund as it comes but Food is all about cravings and I did order very hopefully but disappointed in the end
Food is always good from KFC but delivery service is worst",0
#foodengineering One of the new tastes of biryanis in hyd we ordered bone less chicken biryani and mutton biryani which comes with Gulab jamun .the packing is also up to mark,1
"Ordered haleem from shah ghouse, It has got really very good taste, quantity and consistency. Really satisfied with the order. But samll suggestion, please add some more dry fruits",2
we have got wrong order,0
good,1
My second haleem this year is Shah Ghouse and after that I have tried at 4 different places. Trust me the taste at shah ghouse stands out and it makes you go back at its crowded outlet and have more of it. 100% delicious,2
"I ordered big 8 meal, they cheated ...sent me just big 8 bucket.
I will never order here again.
They should at least read the order correctly.",0
"I ordered an veg corn Maggie which was okay to eat . But the fried maggie's are much more tempting and more tasty .
The only drawback on visiting the shop is that they only accept the cash .",1
forgot to send the spoon.,2
"i don't knw d reason why everytime this particular branch of KFC declines my order.. however other branches who r far dan dis beanch accepts my order.. i do not blame KFC as a whole, but this branch of gachibowli is just ridiculous. if u want to decline the order, den y do u evn take ordrs frm zomato üò†üò°",0
"Fried Maggie's are better compared with the normal one, Normal Maggie's are prepared like soup with more water also sometimes they let the Maggie to burn and add water in it ,that would be horrible. Good to go as a midnight snack.",1
Awesome taste must visit in hyderabad.... Good place to visit with friends or if its for team lunch recently added mandi also... Yummy taste especially haleem,2
"Never go for potato krisper burger .. bad taste and these guys add imli chutney in it ... its taste like what the hell we are eating...
Never go for this",0
"Famous place just before the DLF building in gachibowli,they have a wide variety of Maggi and I would always pick their authentic fried Maggi better to have it at the place rather than ordering online, quantity gets reduces when ordered online than you eat at Maggi point",1
Shah Ghouse is a best place for Hyderabad biryani. Their quality and quantity are really satisfied. They have all the branches with same taste.,2
one piece missing,0
"It's a very small food joint like a pan shop and very crowded since there are many other food joints in the same lane.
It's nothing exceptional but if you really love Maggi then you can give it a try.
We tried fried chicken maggi but are doubtful of it being halal üòê
If anyone knows about it, please let me know.",1
Perfect place to order for mutton Biryani and mandi. Superb taste but a miner issue with this restaurant is it's so busy on weekends and they will not concentrate on ordered items and some times they deliver incorrect order. Otherwise it's awesome...üçñüçó,2
Dips were not delivered. Order incomplete,0
"Its a small joint located near the DLF IT Park. Well who doesnt love Maggi and thats what draws you towards the outlet. You can either visit the place or even place order online. I have tried both methods with varying experience. 
I visited the outlet and Maggi i tasted was much better than when i ordered for home delivery. So one thing probably with Maggi is that you will relish it most of it is prepared and consumed hot without letting it dry. 

Double Egg Chicken Maggi - not as i would have expected it to be 
Double Masala chicken Maggi - definitely worth a try 
Chicken fried Maggi is my personal favorite 

Overall a nice small joint to satisfy your maggi cravings, would suggest order online if you live closeby. 

Overall 3

"Food and taste is fabulous, nothing there to complaint but the way they use containers for delivery need to improve. Sometimes for curry orders packages are leaking out. To be top all the facilities provided by restaurant should be in best qualityüòç",2
quantity was too less,0
Too spicy,1
"Absolutely everything about shah ghouse is amazing. You wouldn't mind the ambience much as food is finger licking good. You can tell that the place serves good food as it is always crowded. They serve the best mutton biryans, shawarmas and murgh musallam ( not sure of the spelling).

Amazing taste as compare to all other restaurants around Gacchibowli Telecom nagar HYDERABAD.they follow all instructions care fully so 5star,2
Eagerly waited for food with kids.... only half order delivered... spent rest of the time chasing the rest of the order......................................,0
"I used to spot this shop opposite to the DLF IT park while coming back from work during my stay in Hyderabad. Always crowded with majority of the IT people nearby and all other food delivery agents waiting to take parcel. Got to know that they are also delivering till the wee hours of the night.

I was wanting to order from here once for that taste of Maggi. Who doesn't like a fancy maggi noodles? So one fine night, ordered for a Corn Masala Cheese Butter Maggi through Zomato.  That was the most fanciest name I could find on their menu. 

The delivery was smooth and the packing was okayish in a plastic box along with a plastic spoon and fork. The maggi was somewhat soggy and some what semi gravyish which I am not that big a fan of. It could have been a bit drier. But the taste was really good and one could feel all the butter & cheese in the maggi.  Good cost effective outlet for the love of Maggi Noodles.",1
The Chicken SP Biriyani was just delicious. Wonderful service. First try in Hyderabad. Definitely one of the best experiences. High speed delivery and hot food.,2
Both the zomato and kfc are cheating employees. Since order is placed on zomato app and delivered by kfc people none of them is willing to take responsibility even when the order is not delivered for two hours. Sad part is zomato is not refunding money which means customers are paying for not having their meals,0
"It's a good find for a quick snack...
The Maggie I ordered served as a perfect comfort food... cheesy and masaledaar! (Cheese Corn masala Maggie)
Looks like a potential regular mid-night snack option",1

"Tried Double egg fried maggi, Double egg double chicken fried maggi , Shawarma here . maggi was good , shawarma was very very bad , was not so tasty and chicken was so different..

Will not order shawarma again ‚úã Good place to have Maggi only üôè",1
No onions for any biriyani full fake delivery. Don't order and believe them they are delivering false biryani and fake identity of original.,2
Really slow delivery and hopeless responses when questioned about the same. If the orders can't be served on time atleast inform customers ahead.,0

Taste wise it's good can try once. Very quick delivery

I have placed order around 3:30 AM which close to my work place and I work for night shift.

Overall okay okay kind of experience late night.",1
Biryani is always tasty. The best part is restaurant remains open till late night. Whenever we have party plan we use to order from shah ghouse,2
"Ordered Zinger burger through Zomato at 21:30 and it took two hours for delivery. When i complained about delay, they say 'Restaurant is saying they have provided the perfect order'",0
"Who can say no to some delicious Maggi! Hunger Maggi point is just the right street food place to hit. Good variety of flavours and brilliantly made Maggi.

The operating time is just perfect. This place is open through the night and the area is lit. You could just go here have a cheap sumptuous meal of Maggie be it 2 or 3 am.

One portion is quite enough to fill your stomach. The place reminds one of college days and Maggi in the stalls around if you can relate.

Personal favourite: veg fried Maggi, would also recommend to try cheese veg Maggi.",1
Mandi seema lovely items. Should definitely try it. But item should be hot üî• to better its taste. Service in the restaurant were not that good for the family orientated people there will be late what ever you try,2

Disappointed !!",0

Apart from this, rest of the food was good but service was lousy.",1

"Worst ever KFC lunch. I was a great fan of KFC and always liked to have it. But now I have decided to not to eat KFC anymore. Chicken is more like RUBBER. I was not able to eat it and thrown everything. Definitely they are using some medicines for fast growth of chicken.
Please don't order from KFC anymore",0
Ordered mushroom chilli and keema biryani. Mushroom chilli was fine but the biryani tasted like pulao. It dint have any aroma and it was not even close to biryani. Totally tasteless.,1
"This is my first order in SHAH GHOUSE. Nice food perfectly cooked. I ordered Prawns biryani and i never had this taste in hyderabad especially aroma of rice was so tasty. Temperature of food, quantity and packing is awasome......",2
the crispy stuff inside the burger was yuk,0
"This place is for peace. If you‚Äôre looking for ambience,try going on the fifth floor. Food is edible but not what i was expecting. Overall, the place was doable to hangout.",1
One of the finest biryanis i have ever seen. My favorite biryani rather than paradise or pista house. Very tasty food and good looking restaurant,2
The smoky grilled are the worst chicken I ever tasted. I just throw away the chicken. Really very dissatisfied with KFC. I will never again visit KFC,0
"We visited this restaurant recently. We have ordered Potpourri Royyala Vepudu, Gongura Mamsam ( not there in the menu, they have made it on our request ) and plain rice.

Potpourri Royyala Vepudu: A south Indian style prawn ( medium sized ) starter (dry). This dish had at least 15-20 prawns. The prawns were coated and cooked in spices. The prawns were little chewy in texture but was very tasty.

Gongura Mamsam: Small pieces of mutton cooked in a gongura based gravy. We found this dish too sour ( I guess they have added tamarind too ) compared to our previous experience with Gongura based gravy.

Overall experience was nice. The service was good.",1
"It's one of the famous restaurants in Hyderabad for Hyderabadi Biryani. It serves several non veg items. This restaurant is quite crowdy. It's a good place for Family Lunch or Dinner.

Their delivery sucks their customer service has dropped pathetic customer service very rude delivery guys who have no manners how to speak to women I will never order from KFC again.Really if you continue to misbehave & ill treat your customers you will pay for it & you will be chucked out of India like Mac Donalds okay never threaten your customers you guys are disgusting.Will never order from you again & I hope you shut down because you do not respect your customers any more.Pathetic & Disgusted with KFC.,0
"Ordered chicken fried rice. Quantity is huge. Taste is strictly ok. The chicken pieces were not nice and I got some bones and cartilage in some of those. So, wouldn't recommend to order chinese again from here. Perhaps their other items are better, not sure.",1
It is completely biryani house.. You will not ‚ùå get satisfied every time. But u can't find these type of biryani in Hyderabad. Very crowded place have to wait much time to get a seat. Ambience is below. Price is very low when compared to other restaurants,2
worst delivery,0
"I went there last Sunday. Had a buffet. Honestly I didn't like the food taste and quality of vegetable and specially non-veg items. It tasted stale. No doubt service is good , staff is always smiling. But they need to improve a lot on food quality. Even the biryani was not up to the mark. Moreover the chicken was undercooked or old, our stomach felt funny when we reached home.",1
"To sum it up - ""Amazingly Delicious"".

We ordered the enormous Tandoori Family Platter, fresh Apollo fish and the massive ""Jumbo Pack"" Biryani.

Tandoori Family Platter (hand for scale) - This beast consist of 5 whole chickens (different kebabs), boti kebabs and seekh kebabs ... Served with 8 rumali rotis
and
Apollo Fish (The plate in top middle which is not so small but looks tiny in front of the platter)

Jumbo Pack Biryani - This delicious biryani is the one to die for. Arguably, one of the best Hyderabadi Biryani, it is served with Egg curry & raita and can easily feed an entire family.

Price:
Tandoori Family Platter: Rs. 1300/-
Apollo Fish: Rs. 240/-
Jumbo Pack Biryani: Rs.600/-

"So I met my brother here for lunch yesterday.

We ordered spring rolls, kaju paneer curry and butter naans.

The best amongst the order was the starter. The curry was just okay, with strong turmeric after taste.

The breads we ordered also arrived cold which made them difficult to chew.

Overall, just an average experience. Would have enjoyed if the naans were better and the curry didn't have so much turmeric in it.",1
One of the best Biryani restaurant in Hyderabad. Kebabs and other mughlai dishes are also delicious. Highly recommended for all non-veg lovers!,2
worst the quality nd quantity is too bad.i hate KFC,0
"Had ordered honey chilli potatoes and veg manchurian from here for a small meetup at home..everyone and i really liked the honey chilli potatoes, the manchurian was very average..was ooozing oil on the bite and didnt hv any manchurian taste..

Didnt go gaga about it nor did i not like it, will try again perhaps this time in the restaurant.",1
"Visited this place on 24 March,2019, as one of my friend invited us to have a lunch party there. We went there around 1 pm and it was pretty difficult to get a car parking there, but we managed one. Not to mention that the place was literally overcrowded! Such is popularity of this place! Lets find out, how the experience was.

Ambiance

=========

Its a multistoried restaurant. And every floor was full to the brim, with several Biriyani crazy people! We got seated at the second floor. The floor was brimming with people and hardly any empty table. The seats were well laid out , comfy and spacious. Ratings - 3.5/5.

Service

=========

The waiter took some time to take the order and quite some time to deliver the food. He paid heed to whatever requests we made and was keen to help. Overall service was fine. Ratings - 4/5.

Food

=========

Here comes the big deal. Lets find out if all the craze that this place generates, is worth it? Actually four of us were there for the lunch and the waiter recommended ""Family Pack"" chicken Biriyani along with Reshmi Kebab and Ginger chicken for starters. The starters arrived and they looked yum! The Reshmi Kebab was wrapped in an fluffy wrapping (made with the non-yolk part of the egg) . The kebabs were so soft that it literally melted in our mouth. The ginger chicken was tasty as well. Must mention that both the starters had ample amount of chicken pieces, which was pretty filling for even four of us. Then came the ""Family Pack"" Biriyani, which was more than enough for even four of us( we even had to parcel the leftover). The Biriyani, here has a very different taste here. Its not that spicy but its delicious! No wonder, this place is so famous! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money

============

All these food, for just thousand bucks! Need I say more. Pisa Vasool. Ratings - 5/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.25

Final Thoughts

=============

If you are in Hyderabad and looking for Biriyani experience ( also soft and yummy kebabs), then visit to this place is an absolute must! Highly Recommended!",2

"The staff here, is confused. First person tells us that paneer items won't be available and that it will take a minimum of 25 mins for any other thing we order and the other person assures us to get everything in 5-10 mins including paneer items.

But the food tasted pretty good.
We ordered few rotis with veg kofta curry
And Chilly garlic fried rice.

The ambience is pretty simple, it's one large seating area with different tables.

"Well, this restaurant looked really appealing and we wanted to try it very badly! So we ordered a lot. Veg and non veg dishes. The best was were the chinese starters. Honey chilli potato was amazing. The shangai veg was also good. Non veg starters were not that great though. And we ordered naan and kadai paneer. There was absolutely no salt and the paneer was really hard. Biriyani was really good and the schezuan rice not good either. I think they added coconut oil to it. I'm really not a big fan of coconut oil. Can visit once.

i ordered punjabi chicken and my experience was horrible. Such a costly thing of rs 300 and such less quantity that hardly one person can eat. The food too was not fresh and was stale and was smelling. had to throw it away and neither zomato nor these ppl lsitened to any queries. I wud suggest not to order from here as u can easily get at this price from good restaurants,0
"This place was in my bucket list since a very long time and my visit to this place is very random. I really liked the traditional ambience. The decor of the place is good. The service was very slow and the staff i felt were little confused.
So, pot pourri please look into that.
And about the food, we ordered Chilli egg, Pandumirchi royyala vepudu, Mamsam pulao, Nellore chepala pulusu with Tandoori naan. The quantity of the food was really good and the food was not different from home food.",1
"Just wow üëå I placed an order for Mutton Laham special mandi, it was really üòã yummy. They provide a bowl of mutton juice along chat Pata üçÖ tomato red chilli üå∂ chutney with this dish & must say it really fetches and satisfies your hunger.
I just say it's a MUST TRY once for sure. üëç",2
"*Fake Rating* !!Beware!!


We ordered galouti kabab and dhaba chicken... both were pathetic and nowhere close to the name of the dish.. orange galouti kabab with yellow paratha...dhaba chicken‚Äôs gravy tasted like toor daal",0
"We were there with so much hunger. At a speed start we have ordered ‚ÄúMiriyala Natukodi vepudu‚Äù and ‚ÄúMamsam Pulav‚Äù. Miriyala Natukodi vepudu was ok! But quantity was pretty good. Mamsam pulav was very good to taste and the spiciness was perfect and quantity was very high. I felt oil is high in both orderes.

Ambience was ok! And service was not so fast!",1
"Went for team lunch on friday, overcrowded and hard to get the place. After 30 minutes of waiting got the table. Ordered tandoori platter and dum Biryani.

Chicken Tandoori is roasted and spices are marinated well and biryani is worth for waiting. Remaining items are better to ignore ( Roti and kebabs)

Dessert - kurbani ka meta is delicious.

Pros: Budget friendly

Cos: long waiting especially on weekends
Ambience.",2
"Was served very bad quality of chicken, even for the second time. They mixed kebab chicken in butter chicken and 2 to 3 varieties of chicken were mixed and chicken is half cooked and had a very bad smell",0
Please include vegetable haleem in menu to order as it is only available in pista house. We can say the best vegatable haleem is available here and served hot.,1
Mutton special Biryani & chicken Biryani are good in taste. Grill chicken was little oily and service was good. It's one of the best place for Biryani lovers.,2
After so much of appreciations was tempted for a punjabi thali And have ordered the same. But the wait was not worth it. Dal was flavoured with colours and paneer was not at all delicious and soft. Wont recommend for a vegetarian punjabi thali.,0
"""Haleem Haleem Haleem""

Hello Peeps;
People Around Us Say Pista House , Pista House During Ramzan Just Because They Prepare Haleem well.

I Was literally Waiting For A Free Time To Go & Have Haleem .
Then Seeing The Very Big Queue Outside The Pista House I Decided To Go Home & Order.

I Ordered Mutton Haleem , Naan & Paneer Butter Masala.
Naan & Paneer Butter Masala Were Mouth Watering To Look At & Even Tasted Soooo Good!!!

Haleem Wasn't that excellent. It Was Ok Ok Because They Added A Lotss Of Spices Like Black Pepper & Cloves.

üëâüëâIt's Irritating When You Chew Haleem & Get Lots Of Cloves In Between When You Chew ( I hope You Understood, Lol)

Paneer Butter Masala : Quantity Was Sufficient For 5 Naans. I Would Rate 5 For The Taste. But I would Rate this Restaurant Upon Haleem Only.

Haleem Taste : As I Said , Not As Expected. It Was Just Ok. Cloves Spoiled My Cup Of Haleem.

I Will Still Give It A Try In Other Branches Of Pista House & Will Let You Know The Reviews.",1
"Been here 3 to 4 times earlier too... This place never dissapoints with their taste and flavours. Not only the biryani but i love the other dishes as well. Anyhow the biryani is the best hereüòç
This time we had chicken majestic, punjabi chicken with butter naan and biryani everything was so good and even the staff was very courteous to us.
Ps: Dont expect a fancy ambience just visit for their food.",2
"Ordered today veg thali via Uber eats. Was reading reviews and expected it to be nice. On the contrary, it was a pathetic experience. Below item wise feedback:
Butter roti- made full of maida and instead of butter, it seems like used edible oil was recycled for these so called rotis. They should call it a naan actually
Salad- carrot was rotten and not too sure who asked you to provide them anyways
Paneer - it is so much stale and so hard to chew. Am sure it has exceeded it's expiry date.
Dal makhani - this was good and loved it. (The only.item in entire meal which I liked)
Mix vegetable - it's only beans with gravy which tastes awful
Mix raita - while the curd part was good, the boondi used was really so stale and it tastes like grease.

Hope you take some action on this and not to cheat customers with the name of authentic punjabi with some nice reviews",0
"Went twice, they have nice decent Ambience. Their mutton galouti kebab is good. But they overcook it sometimes. The achari chicken was good, but the biriyani was too spicy. The butter chicken was sweet and spicy served with perfect butter naan. No complains about the quantity. The quality of the food can be improved.",1
"Great ambience, met an excellent man - Sarbeshwar. Super cool guy and great service. Food and music is excellent. Basil chicken tikka is a must try.",2
"After reading some good reviews went to this place by some search to reach this place. Ordered Punjabi non veg spl thali and amruthsari kulcha with chole. 
I wondered by looking the quantity of items. They are very small quantity. 
Taste of the food is ok, not as read in the reviews it is not great. In non veg spl thali they are providing 2 peach chicken in the gravy, that is spl non veg thali, great joke. VFM 1/5.  
They are not providing drinking water. A eatery/restaurant should provide the drinking water.
I have axis bank card with that they should give 15% disount, when ordering they denied it, after completing the food and went once again by showing him on the mobile that your restaurant is on the webiste, then they gave 10% discount after arguing, they should give 15%.",0
"Food is OK OK. Special Chicken Biriyani was the only good item. Tandoori roti was burnt, after we asked for replacement, we got slightly uncooked one. I wouldn't suggest this place for north Indian cusine.
Ambience is average.
There are mosquitoes & not very clean.
Service time is quick.",1
"Great service by Sarmeshwar. Nice ambience as always. Fantastic music, fantastic crowd. Good food and everything is nice about the place......",2
"Okay to begin with, a 4.3 rated place in food court sounded quite fishy to me. So I was expecting a big bang surprise with their food. I had Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Sweet Lassi and Shikanji.
First, coming to the people who spoke about ""Authentic Punjabi"" food in reviews, guys you are either out of your mind or really need to hit Punjab and eat there!
Shikanji was plain flavoured water that tasted medicinal, Lassi was the worst one I have had lately. The Amritsari Kulcha and Chole was tasteless. The dollop of ""Butter"" didnt taste as it was meant to.
Overall a very disappointing experience.",0
"Had ordered almond cake from pista house.
It was not much fresh but tastes okay.
Over all seemed like they have not delivered fresh cake as I saw water was also coming from the cake.
Hope so that from the next time they deliver fresh cakes",1
"This is the best place for beer lovers. With my few friends, we aare at otm gachibowli. Loved the ceaft beer, white high, üçé cider. And the food is awesome. We ordered mecican pizza , burmese parcel we just loved it. The ambience is simple best. Loved it.",2
Terrible. Chicken masala curry had only 1 piece which was about one inch square on the bone. Extremely hot...cant taste any major spiced except loaded red chilly. Gave me gas for a good 30 mins.,0
Tried zafrani chicken biryani... Ordered it for home delivery. Its was ok. Not that uch special. Half egg was an addition. Still the taste is just ok,1
Good food and nice craft beer. Service from sarveshwar. Lunch platter on weekday is quite expensive. Tables are well places so it does not seem way to crowded,2
I didn't get any gravey item sherva.. how can we eat without gravey don't you have sense to send without sherva along without Biryani...,0
"Cakes were really good and tasty in Pista House. Though the models are quiet simple and normal, flavors were really good. Loved the Mango flavor cake.",1
Awesome place to chill. Must visit.miss it at ur own risk. Lager beer is awesome. Serving is professional esp. Johny suggested nice menu. Enjoyed starters. Khandari murgh rikka is juicy. Nice ambience,2
"I received hens hair in chicken haleem,,........, Also I ordered chicken 65 biryani but received veg biryani.. What kind of customer service is that....",0
U went here as i heard their haleem was great. But unfortunately they serve haleem only during ramzan. This place is great for kebabs. Biriyani is great too. The portion size is quite huge.,1
Amazing service by Kamal !! He was really quick with the service and appreciate his recommendations on the menu!! Keep up the good work !!! üòä,2
"Yukkkkkksssssssss!!!!!!!
Yukkkssssssssssss!!!!!!!
I can‚Äôt write anything more. The afghani chicken was bad. Only the omlet in it was good. Chicken pieces were horrible.",0
"Happy to have Pista House set up a branch in cyberabad, the choice of food here is fantastic with a wide array of desserts,snacks and shakes for people to order.
I personally love their salads(Chicken, tuna) as they are done with fresh ingredients and served well.
They need to work on their milk shakes and other shakes as they don't taste the way they look, the taste is bland for the shakes.
Another important concern is the pricing the price of items is different at different outlets, the same stuff at tolichowki is cheaper compared to the Gachibowli branch.",1
Best place to hangout with friends. I have been here with my friends for weekday party after ofc hours. Good service by Sarveshwaar. Must visit place.,2
Chicken 65 not good because small and cooler red more and more . udjjsekjawigsjeisijueusoawjhssslbsksoegjsfak date s have hdaivdbskbduauhsjsjjskakskskskhdvdhsjs,0
Been here. Food is average. Causal dining. For me all biryanis are same. So nothing special. Average ambience. Average service but little crowded.,1
Service is amazing!!! Three cheese mushroom is a must try dish. Love the ambience too. And the Ceasar‚Äôs chicken salad was good.. wish it had more chicken though.,2
Very bad and untasty food. I doubt if it was even fresh. The chicken looked so unhygienic and old. I Wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.,0
Nice ambience and the food was upto the mark... Looking up for more visits to this place ... Sunday trifle was great... We had biriyani and chicken nawabi... Biriyani was of much good quantity...n nawabi chicken was a bit spicy .,1
Prathu has done a very good job.He was polite and friendly.He knows very well how to deal with the customers.Otm is a right place to hangout...,2
"I ordered 1 plate noodles & 1 plate Manchurian, from which Noodles taste was very bad. So I recommend that not order noodles from this restaurant.",0
Decent place. Try this place for Hyderabadi biryani. Very close to the prominent places. Parking is an issue though. Avoid during peak hours.,1
Great place and amazing ambience .. perfect location .. excellent service from Sarvesharam.. good beers especially the in house brews and great food .. must visit place .. music is always good too ..,2
I ordered Afghani chicken from here but I got Curry chicken with mix of omlate.i really disappointed from zomato.why they have this type of hotel in ordered list.i request zomato to please block this restaurant.,0
"Heard a lot about the place and had clean and nice food delivered at home. So I finally decided to pay a visit to the place myself. (High Expectations)

The place was nowhere near what I had imagined. The restaurant wasn't a very neat and hygienic place, the plates were dirty and the cutlery and sauce storage boxes tainted and dirty. The people there were not welcoming too and their uniforms were half tucked in.
Moving on to the good part, the food was cleaner than most non veg places in Hyderabad with the Chicken having a little less oil than most places. The desserts looked sumptuous (even though I was full for them, I manged to take some pictures of them)

So from now on I am just going to get myself a delivery from that place rather than actually going there and if I go there, it would be for the sole purpose of trying out the desserts!",1
"I really like the place.

We ordered
Chicken poppers - 4/5
Peri peri Chicken wings - 5/5 (Very spicyüå∂)
California Chicken Pizza - 4/5
Service is lightning quick; really friendly and Efficient Staff.

Perfect Hangout place, if you like fresh Brewed Beer and good food, amazing ambience and Light Music. If you are zomato Gold member, You have one + one on Food too.",2
"If there was zero stars then i could have given that, never order food from here, the chicken which they have served was completely stale, the rotis was cold. Very much poor experience !!",0
"Pista house‚Äôs haleem is what I look forward to always. On a vacation to Nizam‚Äôs Hyderabad, we thought we will try one of their chicken dishes and thus chose:

Dum ka Murg & Tandoori roti.

A little above average food and overly filled staff who made it a little rushed up dining experience. Didnt get time to breathe coz the staff kept coming to check on you. No doubt thei service was prompt but at times felt it was too prompt. They should give customers little time to breathe to order food and finish it with peace.

Next will try their haleem and some desserts too.",1
"With wooden closed windows covering the walls on the inside, warm well lit ambiance was a stark contrast to other restaurants. We were welcomed by a vintage salsa music with professionals dancing gracefully lifting the mood of the place.
I would recommend you to try 'Dream of Love '.
The menu is extensive. All the dishes we tasted were delicious.
We came out with lifted spirits over the moon",2
There were offers running around and we ordered chilli chicken and chicken 65 from this place. Even though having average reviews thinking that the food might be ok but then the food was average and it was not fresh I guess and so it affected our health.,0
"Pista house, known for Haleem in the month of Ramzan.
Orders Haleem from Swiggy,
Tastes good.
Deliver was quick and
the haleem is hot as well.

Overall ok.",1
OTM has always been one of our favorites but tonight it was a good experience with my 8month old baby. Very cooperative staff special mention to Mr. Sarveshwar. Excellent food and service. Will visit again soon,2
"Worst food i ever had
I have ordered chicken chilly chicken 65, both are tasteless, i think they have cooked it in afternoon & delivering in night",0
"Had their Reshmi kebab served with omlette on the top it was good
ginger prawns were oky but their serving quantity was good.
Chicken biryani and haleem was good as usual .",1
"Nice service, soothing music and great ambiance! Mr. Sarweshwar was very cordial and prompt at service! Had some different types of food and drinks for the first time.
Would love to visit this Gachibowli branch again!!",2
"Food tastes very very bad.i ordered chicken biryani and tangidi kebab.rice wasnt boiled well and kebab was not cooked at all .I suggest no 1 should order from this hotel zara Hi-fi.Guys just dnt see the pics and order, also see the reviews aswel.",0
"We've ordered for Crispy Corn and its was too oily and salty.Egg biryani was okay.service and ambiance is good.
Should take more care for the food.",1
Loved the place. Great food and ambience. Sarveshwar gave us good recommendations and was courteous throughout. Would definitely look forward to coming here again.,2
I ordered from this place before. It was good. But I had a very bad experience with the last order. I ordered kadai chicken. The pieces were spoiled. The gravy was smelling really bad. I am not happy with the service. Not going to order from here again.,0
"Was really waiting to visit this place after all the good reviews. Was quite disappointed with the food and the menu of the buffet. Not a single stand out dish , chettinad chicken was salty and inspite of me telling them multiple times they turned a deaf ear. Deserts are so so. Biryani was fine but chicken was very dry , same case with the fish starter just horrible. Fruit custard had only bananas.even their water tasted like chemically treated. Service was alright but this place is highly over rated on zomato.",1
Was very pleased and surprised how lovely the place was and delicious food 10/10! Mr. Deepak welcomed us with BIG Smile and made our Evening very pleasant and memorable! I recommend this place 100% worth every penny! @Kavita&Kiran,2
"I have ordered food from this place a couple of times. Each time was a disappointment. The food is extremely spicy, lacks taste, and the meat that they serve seems stale.",0
Food was delicious. But the ambience and the service provided were poor. Every order took at least 40mins to be served. Very poor cleanliness. Not sure if I would visit again for a hang out.,1
"Nice place with courteous staff. Goooood beer. Anytime.
Very good food.
One of the best places in Hyderabad. Anytime better than hoppery ( for beer and food).",2
"Tasteless & Worst food ever I ate, Had one bite and had to throw rest & also not Hygeine at all.

When it comes to packing even road side vendor do better than these people.",0
"We like to explore all places which serve good nonveg food and seeing the reviews on zomato, decided to try this restaurant near dlf in gachibowli. Overall experience was ok and nothing great. They have a big dinning area. We ordered marsala special chicken gravy and roti. Which was with an omelette on top. The taste wasn't something special and we could not get the proper flavour of this gravy. Basa fish tikka was not as soft as we get it elsewhere. Usually it melts in mouth and is super soft and tasty but we were disappointed here.",1
"A nice place to hangout with friends and have drinks.
Must try the brewed beer. I tried the OTM ledger, which was pretty good.

Food wise pizza was pretty good. We ordered the mexican pizza. Along with crispy lotus stem and water chestnuts.

Deducting one star for poor service and lack of staffs which resulted in delay in services.",2
Worst quality of food. Have faced vth butter chicken n butter nons from here. Worst i have eaten till date. I rate this 1/10. Please improve hotel zara..,0
"Been to this place after looking at the ratings. We had a mushroom Moti tikka for starter which tasted sweet and we could barely finish the starter due to its sweetness. In the main course we had chicken biryani which was just decent with bland taste and little masala. The service was decent and so as the ambience.
I would rate this place as
Food - 3/5
Service - 3.5/5
Ambience - 3.5/5",1
"Breweries were good!
Good ambience, average food!
Would really love to visit again though, last time around I didn‚Äôt get a chance to explore much!!
It‚Äôs definitely worth a visit, a good place to hangout!",2
I order chicken biriyani handi... it has nothing .. its like podi meals and 2 bitter milk pocket and i am not able fully beacuase its not tasty also... fully waste of money,0
"Chilly corn in veg starters were very good, tandoori paneer veg starter was not up to mark,lot of oil ,even bread crumbs in tomato soup were too oily. Rest ambience and service are good here.",1
I have been here quite a few times now. This place is amazing. The steward Keshav was really polite and helpful and made sure we had a good experience. The food is amazing.,2
horrible portion of chicken and disastrous mirchi ka salan if i rate all my biryani experience in last 15 years this will be at the bottom of pasific i got 3 pieces of 65 in chicken 65 biryani and half Brest piece of chicken biryani god why did i ever order from this cheap place,0
"Marsala Food company is an alright place to have a quick lunch if you don‚Äôt want to travel far from work. We ordered a mutton biryani and literally had to tug the mutton pieces apart; they were really hard. The food is fine and doesn‚Äôt actually reach the fine dining standards the restaurant boats of. The place could use better service and food quality.
Overall, not a bad place to have a meal.",1
"One of the best places to chill and drink in Hyderabad. The Japanese fried chicken, the kung pao chicken and the beautiful ice cold brewed beer ( we loved the Weizen Bock beer) are the best. Ask for Kamal who is simply the sweetest and the best server at the place. He recommended the best dishes and the best beer. Make sure to ask for Kamal when visiting OTM. Cheers!!!",2
"Food delivery was taken 1 hr 10 mints, and food is very high spicy unable to eat, so we have thrown in dustbin. Worst experience with this restaurant.",0
I have ordered mandi rice and fried chicken piece. The rice is not up to mark and chicken is medium. The gravys also not thick. Over all the food is average and ambience is good.,1
"One good place to hangout.Ambience here is very good.
We ordered Kukad de sang and River and sea food platter.Both tasted very good.

Food : 4/5
Service : 4/5
Ambience : 4/5",2
I ordered fries rice and Manchurian. First i will talk about the quantity it was upto thw mark as per the price of the food abd now coming to the taste . Fried rice was disgusting because it was like made from rice of last night and it was not good to eat. Coming to Manchurian i will say it was a average Manchurian and not that good.,0
"Went there for dinner. Tried Chicken Mandi and double ka meetha. Quantity of Mandi was good for two. Double ka meetha was average. Ambience and service was ok but could have given 4 stars if the AC could have been a little high and service a little fast. I also feel they should also take care of the taste of dishes as there are so many good competitors around.

Amazing service and food. Belgium beer is amazing. I really want to appericate makhan he is a great bartender. The way approaches and give service to people is amazing. People like makhan is making over the moon succcess..,2
Almost 20 of my friends had vomited the food within a couple of hours after eating. The price of the items is cheap so is the quality of food.,0
"Visitng the place around 10 pm and the ataff was not friendly at all.
Nice location
Decent ambience
Require a bigger or brighter hoarding in order to spot the location",1

ok ok,0
"Average food and ambience. Though food range is good and has a good pick of Arabic, Indian and Chinese. Not enough parking. Service is OK. Not much crowded on weekend when we went.",1
Great service by Parthou and great recommendations on the food and drinks. Highly recommended to enjoy your Friday evenings. Service was top notch n drinks were great.,2
"I ordered Chicken 65 from this restaurant on 19th feb 2019, the quality of the food was not good, i had vomitings immediately after having the food..",0
"This was our first visit. While the ambience is nice, we felt that their food was okay.

Basa fish tikka: it wasn't as soft and melting into our mouths as normally it should. We have had better tikkas. Would rate 3/5

Marsala special chicken curry: again nothing special about the preparation except that they served it with an omlet. 3/5",1
"If you ever want to enjoy amazing food and desserts and drinks then please, I request you, please visit this place. Great ambiance and music. We had ordered Mexican Pizza, Chicken platter, seafood platter, Chicken Penne pasta. In desserts, Cheesecake and Brownie and Ice cream was the best. üòç",2
Quality is decreasing exponentially i request you to please dont order food here why because my health got damaged very badly after eating food here.,0
"Visited this place on a weekday afternoon, and it was mostly empty. But by the decor it felt that the place will look lively in the evenings, so will give it a shot sometime. Happy hours was on, so we got Absolut for ~150 (Smirnoff was ~70 - which seemed like a better deal), along with the other stuff. Tried a couple of veg & paneer starters. Food was nothing to write home about - but overall a decent (and pocket-friendly) place for a quick afternoon round of drinks.",1
"Good and fast service. Yummy food. Steak is worth it! Great service by Kamal. Apple cider beer was fabulous.
Overall a great experience. Worth visiting again",2
"I have ordered veg manchuria from this hotel the manchuria was very bad and worst taste too,
Even I didn't eat single piece of manchuria ,
Waste of money",0
"You like crowd?!
like really big crowd ?! Then this is the place you should go!! Also drinks are so cheap here!

Service was okay for me, nothing worth mentioning!
Music wasn‚Äôt that good! Just loud!
Not so great food!

You got the good and bad about this place!!
you decide whether to go or not :)",1
"An awesome place. A usual hangout if you like fresh brewed beer and some great music and lovely ambience. The best part is the really friendly and efficient staff with Keshav leading the pack. Don‚Äôt miss out on Burmese parcels, 3 cheese mushrooms and non veg kuttu parotta while you are here.",2
"Very poor food, it wasn't fresh. Too much oily, chapati you can't even chew so much refined flour. I ordered chicken but it was not fresh.Disappointed..",0
"The ambience was decent, but we went for a ladies night and it was a tad bit crowded (understandable!). The music was good, the only downside to the whole thing was that the person giving out drinks at the counter was downright ignoring us. We actually became a little uncomfortable after that, because we were right in front of him, waving hands (not drunk at all, because we were asking for out first drink of the night), and he was handing out drinks to everyone else except us. Looks like he had something againts us! ;)",1
"Awesome place to hangout. Food is great. Had lovely time with friends. One of their staff Sarbeswar was very good. We had pizza, nonveg platter and chicken wings.",2
"If anyone wants to order from this restaurant, think before you order the food, they will give the biryani rice from Chicken Biryani even if you order for a Veg Biryani, and the butter naan will be like a chewing gum, u have to chew it for a long time to swallow it...........",0
"Overcrowded is the first thing that comes to my mind. They have a really big place but I guess not well managed, it‚Äôs like open for all, people smoking everywhere. DJ was below average and the sound systems can improve.

Overall 3/5
Ambience 2/5
Food 4/5",1
Ever felt like you want to sit and just relax.. no thoughts moving past you except the cool breeze... And some light music and some good lights? This is the right the place.. if not so right then just THE place... Thanks to the ambience and good music and of course the food.. and thanks to Keshav for his amazing service and a complimentary gift gesture! Which none the less make you feel the part of the place! Cheers!,2
"I am wondering how this restaurant has a 3.5 rating.

Ordered shahi paneer thinking it's the safest bet. The curry even looked disgusting. It was too oily and didnt taste like shahi paneer. I could only eat the paneer pieces. Thankfully they were soft.
I would not even pay 20 rs for that curry. 100 is quite a big amount.",0
"Cheap n Crowded even on weekdays

Ladies night all weekday (mon-thu)

Excellent place to get drunk n dance like crazy

Music was loud n awkward - all hindi songs that too many unknowns
Dj was below average - seems like youtube videos autoplay was playing

Great for people who want some fun on weekdays",1
"Nice place. Went out here twice with my friends. Great beer menu. Awesome food options as well. They have a quite a different variety of food available from snacks to main course, from desi to continental, from Street snacks to authentic cuisine. Live music is good as well. I like the ambience which is dark with soft lights. Enjoyed my time here. Would love to visit again. Over the moon

The taste is very bad and the quantity is very very very. Very very lessssssssssssssssss. Which will not be sufficient. Very bad packing also,0
Okay ! This place seems okay not so great. Tables are too small in which we cannot put more than three food items. And it was saturday night the DJ supposed to start at 8pm we were waiting for the songs to be played till 9:30pm yet no music nothing. And we left the place.,1
"When it comes to experience, this is one of the places I ll remember for long...Went on a Saturday night and was welcomed with sweet Latin music with people dancing in some Latin form... Could be salsa or any other form considering they have so many...definitely they were not the guests, looking at their proficiency... Very good food... Not so great beer from their in house brews... You will be shocked to see some healthy variants... Worthy try though... Overall a must go place for the experience.",2
Food is pathetic. I was not able to eat it was too spicy n salty. I ordered kadai chicken but received only 1 piece of chicken.Very bad experience. Naan was totally black in color.,0
"Read mixed reviews about this place. But the only thing which dragged us here is that the DJ here plays Bollywood songs and we were satisfied with the DJ and the dance floor. The place is also very beautiful. But the service here sucks, the waiters are rude. We couldn't order food as the waiters weren't responding properly. Even for drinks (tired of waiting for them to take order) we went to the bar and ordered.
So if you you to enjoy only the dance floor, only them I would recommend this place.",1
"If trying brewed beer is what you love to do ... This place is a must visit . It's has a very rustic and welcoming ambience. One of their best beer would be the OTM Lager. For starters we had crispy lotus stem with water chestnuts and trust me when I say it's one of the best vegetarian starters I had in a while . The lotus stem is crispy and water chestnuts leave a refreshing feel on your palate. The sauce is sticky , sweet and sour and is surely a celebration of flavors. I would strongly recommend this dish as a must try. Also had the crispy shitake mushrooms they has a tangy flavor and a crispy texture. The chicken Tikka was one of the best tikkas I had. The meat was tender and perfectly Cooked.The mint chutney was a perfect match to go with.
If you want to drop in to grab a quick bite and some drinks after a hectic day at work ... This would be the perfect place.",2
Such a bad dry biryani and soggy chilly chicken.Better close your restaurant.I donot like when food goes to dustbin.such a waste preparation of food.,0
"Everytime I go to this place, I‚Äôve experienced different experience. The staff is fine but I didn‚Äôt like the DJ. Only once I have enjoyed a lot with good music out of 5 times. A heart cup is far better than this.",1
"it's been always great to be at OTM, Kaishav has been a delight every time. great host, highly recommended for food and drinks. very responsive team and try to do whatever they can to make customer feel happy",2
Food is not that good. Quantity is more but quality is less.,0
Greetings. The ambience is good ( okayish! ) with artificial plants towards the gallery area. Too dark for a pub. Sitting is good. Dedicated Dance floor with good Hindi new and old songs to garnish upon. Too loud though. Don‚Äôt have draught beer. Have pint prices slightly towards higher side. Crispy corn made the day ( night! ). Do try!,1
Best service ever! Sarveshvar rao did the best service ever i am so happy with his service and hospitality. Please recognise his efforts and wish him the best in the world,2

Excellent place for hangout with friends. Nice Ambience. Sarveshwar...thanks for your service. Overall good experience. Keep music loud guys..:),2
I received my life times worst ever noodles from here....got a smell and taste like it is burnt over coal...though it has been two days since I tasted...my buds still remember the taste. Hate that and no response from Zomato for the complaint even now. I don't prefer to order or have something from this place again.,0
"My friend gave his birthday treat here! We opted for the buffet going on there. Buffet was not that great! Buffet had one chicken starter one vegetarian starter one main course (we opted for non vegetarian option) choice of roti biryani and Gilab jamun.
The ambiance was great. We clicked alot of pictures there! It was fun overall.",1
"This is good place to hangout, Hospitality of this restaurant is very good. Went to this place with bunch of friends had a great time and good üçª",2
Poor quality and quantity and food is not nice and packing is not nice and food is not taste full and feeling sad why I ordered this food from this restaurant,0
"Well the service needs to be a bit organised. The staff is polite. But it's overcrowded place at weekends. Otherwise the pricing and ambience is quite good enough.
Cheers",1
"With great music and ambience the excitement for the final IPL match was enhanced.
The food is great along with the exotic drinks.
Must try is the cock in the basket which is fried chicken breast.",2
"Really disappointed with the food quality.The food makes me sick.Ordered chilly chicken and schezewan chicken fried rice...the quality of the chicken is really bad...if they want to negotiate with the quality of the food then they can increase the price of the food.
Please take care of the quality..",0
The non veg starter items (specially chicken) comes on good quantity and are tasty too. The ambience is little shady. The service is satisfactory.,1
"Great ambience. The food tasted good as well. Removing one star because of lack of vegetarian options; if they add more options before my next visit, I'll gladly revisit my rating.",2
no test less quality,0
"The music here is too loud even for a club. You can't hear what other person is saying even if they are speaking in your ear. Ambience is cool. Food is okay. I think the good thing about this place is that price is a bit low compared to similar places. And because of ladies night almost every day of week, you will never find the place dull and empty even on weekdays. Also I feel the dance floor lighting is bit too bright for my liking.",1
"Deepak sir - the gem of all person ,hes the best anyone can even ask for any pub all over hyderabad ,come have some good times with this person service over the moon for sure",2
"worst experience ever and never received such option from ZOMATO , the food served was spoiled one , however delivery by zomato was appreciable , complete wastage of money , should have spoiled my health , never suggest one to order from it.",0
"Ambience was good but when we were drunk , the waiter has charged extra 100 on our bill. Please ask the management not to misuse the customers",1
Extremely delighted by the service by Mr. Kundan. Indubitably one of the best brewed beers in Hyderabad. Great service levels and ambience offered by this place.,2
chicken bad smell and seems it got spoiled.,0
"Went there for my husband's birthday.

We ordered fish and chips and Basa fillet.
In both the dishes the fish were not served fresh.

Service was not that great either as it was the busy hour and only one server was seen trying to serve everyone.

Ambience is excellent as one side of the hotel is the botanical garden and the other part is the hi-tech city. A beautiful contrast.

Food: 2
Service: 3
Ambience: 5

Will I visit the place next time ?!?! Yeah, may be for the ambience and no ""fish"" dish. :)",1
"Nice place to go to catch up with friends over a couple of drinks. Live music nights are really soothing and the ambiance is great. Service can improve. In house brew collection is good but can add more variety to it, since customers look for ranges. Thanks!",2
The chilli chicken was so bad when i ordered. The quantity was even less. Not worth the money at all. Noodles were tasteless but quantity was fine. Overall not a good experience.,0
"Wanted to checkout this new place and this visit we visited Mazzo and opted for A‚Äôla Carte. Overall only the Drinks, Soup and Fish and Chips were good, service was good. The value of food experience was not satisfactory and I wouldn‚Äôt visit next time.

Asian Clear Soup Chicken - Just Warm
Sweet Corn Soup Chicken - This is better than Clear Soup
Lamb Pepper Fry - Cold, Rubbery, No Sign of Pepper, Tasted like South Indian Dry Chicken Curry
Roasted Spring Chicken - Tasted Bland due to thickness of Chicken Breast
Fish and Chips - This was decent enough

"Went for quick bite with friends and loved the place üòä.
People were supper friendly and the food was awesome.
We were so full.
Loved the chicken pizza
Fish fry and
Palak Tika
Last but not the least the orange mocktail (sorry don't remember the name) was just awesome.

Great job OTM ü§©",2
only one small piece of chicken was sent. worst experience ever!,0
"Went for my birthday dinner on Friday night here with my wife
Ambience is good. But food is very ordinary.
We ordered only 2 items, fish and chips, and sea bass fillet with vegetables. Both of them were not fresh.
Service was not stand out either.
Overall a very meh experience.",1
"In a nutshell.. OTM has the best brewed beer I've ever tasted in Hyderabad. We tried moonlight, Apple cider and forscher. All tasted amazing.

Food was good too.

Only reason am giving a 4 and not 5 is the air conditioner for some God damn reason was not effective enough. Be ready to sweat! We had to remind waiter who was attending us constantly to keep it cool.

Oh yes, no surprise.. World famous kundan was serving our table, so no complaints with the serving partüòÖ
He did well serving us.",2
Too spicy,0
Giving three stars only because of the good staff and the amazing ambiance near the pool. Completely disliked the food which I felt was half cooked and tasteless.,1
"This place never missed to surprise when it comes to Service.
5 Star will be small, i would like to add more stars.
Special Thanks to Kundan for Amazing Service.
LITE was the best in Hyderabad.
Food is awesome. Must Try Veg Spring Roll.
Once again Thanks for Service Kundan üòäüòäüëçüëçüëçüëåüëåüëå",2
"This is one of the worst restaurants I have ever eaten from.I generally don't give bad reviews to anything. But, this food was exceptionally bad.",0
"The ambience was really nice, rooftop view makes it for a quiet romantic outing, the staff were nice. But the food was served cold and wasn't up to to the Marriott standards. Breathtaking view and the quaint corner near to the pool balanced our entire evening.",1
"Awesome restaurant with responsive people and food tastes great, personally peri peri chicken fry is the most liked dish by me from this restaurant.",2
Not tasty at all. Bad quality.,0
"This place has an awesome ambiance, it is really worthy to spend money on this place. It is the best place to chill out with girlfriends üòú but the food it just average",1
Very good place for food and drinks and good ambiance. Speaclly i would like to thank me. Karunakar who helped us by his service we are very thankful to him.... guys pls visit otm gachibowli.....,2
The food was very spicy.,0
"Been there for brunch, food is average at best. Ambience was good and service also pretty good. Aritra the staff there was very friendly.
The place has a lot of potential, lovely view and swimming pool area. They should improve food and also the menu itself.",1
"I have been to OTM a couple of times and its an amazing place to have good food and drinks. Server, Mr Karunakar, is very helpful and is a very patient and nice server.",2
"Really worst biryani you can ever have in Hyderabad.

Road-side stalls make better than this Zara HI-FI place. Never expect any better from this place.
It will be good if you refrain from ordering here so that you can save your money and taste.",0
"Went there for dinner with family,it's located just above SLN Terminus.
Must say it has a terrific ambience and decor, especially loved the poolside view of the place,but the food is strictly average and their service is terribly slow and a big let down.",1
"Food and ambience is nice..
Chiken chettinadu and Chicken pulao is toooo good so as beer and vodka....
And I appreciate Kamal's quick sevice..üëçüëç",2
Chicken Biryani taste is good but the quality of chicken of is degrading day by day. Try to maintain the same quality as earlier days so that you may not lose customers. I'm noticing this change from last 3 orders. I'm giving this feedback to bring these things to your notice only.,0
Reservation was confirmed on the phone multiple times as I was hosting a group of 20 people but we didn't have a table when we reached. I was told that I spoke to one employee but the other employee didn't know so its not his responsibility. I however contacted the hotel so not sure how I am supposed to inform ALL employees for a simple reservation. It was quite an inconvenience because the whole group was made to stand for 15 mins and wait and move tables as well. The staff was not apologetic either so we were quite disappointed. This was a corporate booking with colleagues so we would not have expected this to happen,1
"This is one of the classier places to party in Hyderabad. They have great music usually on Fridays and Saturdays, when the party fever is high. On Sundays though, it's a bit mild relatively. The food is good, and drinks are even better. Go there to have a good time with friends.",2
The food wasn't good at all. I had the food and within half and hour I had a stomach problem. Please don't buy food from this restaurant. Worst Experience.,0
"The place has an amazing ambiance, nice seating at rooftop beside the pool with amazing view. And all 3 stars goes for it. But the food is not great at all.. u can go there just to enjoy the view, but food a big NO.. the biriyani was very dry, hardly any options for starters or desserts. The staff were extremely courteous and srrvice was also okay.",1
"Great finger food and drinks and a extremely friendly and attentive staff. The main course options are a bit limited for vegetarians but whatever is available is good.

My personal favorite is their infused drinks.

For a micro brewery they are quite kids Friendly.",2
"I am Chinese food lover...so thought of trying this out.. ordered the below stuff (screenshot). I don't know if I should cry or laugh.. definitely no where close to Chinese cuisine...also ordered Afghani chicken..they just fried an omelette and put some chicken in gravy and calling it Afghani chicken.. pathetic..Zomato should seriously think if they should be listed in their app for ordering..this restro is equivalent to a footpath road side shop..

Second update @ 2.27 am ..I puked ...I so regret having this food",0
"3 stars only for the ambience of this place. Its amazing !! For once, you forget that its actually in the city. Zero stars to the food though. We went for a sunday brunch. Limited menu and not so tasty food. Prawns were half cooked. To my surprise, drinks were good. Had apple Martini, which was really nice. But there are better sunday brunches in hyderabad than this.",1
"We've been here a few times....
A cool place to hang out, both with frns & family...
Beer battered fish is jus awesome...on our 1st visit few months back, we've got couple of lemonade's as a complimentary too...overall a 5star experience !",2
Chicken curry ordered but it's not up to the mark. Birayani not fully boiled. Butter chicken is not good no spicy it's sweet combination not feeling well while having.,0
"Starting with the ambience it has a warm indoor and a pleasant outdoor with a pool
Polite staff
Food of gd taste (chicken biryani a must try )
Very late service ; takes around 20 minutes though the crowd is very less !",1
absolutely loved the food and ambience. Special thanks to Keshav for the wonderful service. Should try their signature vegetarian starters:-),2
Worst experience with delivery time.. It took 2 hrs to deliver a food for 10 min distance place.. Really bad experience.. Hope it improves..,0
"Great ambiance with very poor service.

Food : 3.5/5 The starters were just OK, main course was a little better. For the price you pay and with the limited menu you want the tastes to be bang on and that was not the case. What disappointed most was the drinks, even a classic margarita was not properly made. It was orange is color and that is definitely not OK. 

Ambiance : 5/5 It definitely stands out for its ambiance. Lovely infinity pool overlooking the city and a sitting next to that really makes you feel awesome. One of the most beautiful ambiances among Hyderabadi restaurants.

Service : 2/5 This is where it is most disappointing, you will have to call multiple times to have someone cater to you. And after order it takes an immense time for the food to arrive. Service standards definitely needs to be improved for it to be counted among the fine restaurants of the city.

Price :  3/5 It is priced at per with some of the fine dining restaurants. But to be in the same league food taste and service would need to be improved.

Overall would probably visit them again for the ambiance but with the hope that service improves.",1
"Overthemoon is extremely lively place with great music and tasty food. Ambience is quiet spacious. They have wide range of their own brewed beers.
At the beginning I was disappointed with services but they made it up with their top services.
A very decent place to hangout with your friends for some quality of time.
Rating - (4.5/5)",2
food is not good I never taste in my life and the parking too bad The rotis and curry is too bad I don't want to give the restaurant one star rating also,0
Visited on Christmas eve. I must say overall ambience is good. But buffet desert menu is limited and cost of the buffet must be updated on online zomato menu.(i.e online mentioned rate 999+ taxes which is actually 1200+ taxes),1
"Extreme lively place with great music and great food. I was disappointed at the beginning with their service but they made it up with their top service later on. Pizza's are good here, so is the brewed beer.",2
Order was late so called the restaurant. They started yelling the moment he picked the call saying '' we are not responsible. See before calling. And was extremely rude ''. Clearly they have no regard for customer and hence very well explains why the food is cheap,0
Very nice Mandi. All Mandi r best but service for Briyani section is not good. Quantity for the price is best pieces in Mandi r best. Go with friend to eat mandi,1
"Located in Gachibowli, this place is a perfect place to unwind on a weekend. Loved the ambience both outside and inside. Staff is courteous and prompt. They serve good variety of draught beer and is must try.
Recommended.",2
"The taste was good, but I hardly found 2 chicken pieces and a lot of tomatoes and onions.",0
"Green bawarchi is a most familiar restaurant in Hyderabad. They spread over Hyderabad. You will find any green bawarchi near your area.

Coming to this like all green bawarchi restaurants, they have crowd for taken away customers. We had take many times.

Coming to dine here. It's like any normal restaurant with basic interiors. We have to wait 25-30mins after order something. We had grilled chicken, butter chicken, butter naan, rumali roti and chicken biryani. I like their chutney which comes with chicken. Biryani was nice but little spicy. Roti and butter naan both were fine.

Pocket friendly. We can go with family and friends.

Food 4/5
Ambience 2/5
Service 3/5
Value for money 4/5

Overall an option to have food according to your convenience.",1
"This place was decently crowded for a thursday evening. Ambience was nice and with the perfect music on, it just added life to the whole setup.
Coming to the menu they have good amount of beer options to choose from. We ordered Apple cider beer and it was amazing. And from the food options we ordered three cheese mushroom and California chicken pizza. Both the items were good. It was great experience.
Also I would like to give shout-out to Keshav for his prompt service.",2
"Worst place..
Once I ordered Afghani Chicken and after having the chicken I came to know that the chicken was stale.
Pathetic People and Staff.
If you can't give good food then don't give.",0
"sorry for the late review , ordered for mutton biryani hundi taste was good but not great good quantity with the high quality meat , but they have to follow the instruction which the customer has placed i have ask them to give double spice but they did not followed . one thing for that the rating will be 3 will see in next ordered how they react to the instructions.",1
"Ah! OTM, what can I say. This is a beauty of a spot. A cold beer and OTM make for the best of times.Ditch the usual choices and try out their in-house specialities, you will not regret it. Bringing the microbrewery culture to Hyderabad, this place is a must for anybody looking to chill, beer and eat all the same time, plus they have games!! So, head over there and let your hair down a little. I would recommend this place over and over!
P.S try out their apple cider beer, it‚Äôll blow other beers out of the water!",2
Extremely bad taste. Very very vry bad,0
The quantity was great but the mutton pieces were just 4 numbers out of which 3 were bones as well. Only average impression to offer. Hope the will keep the standard better.,1
"Restaurant Ambience is Nice.
Food is TastY and cost is reasonable.
Staff is Polite.
TheY offer 4-5 different varieties of Beer and it tastes amazinG.",2
The food was not good. The chicken pieces were stinking. also the bread was hard instead of being soft. please refund my money,0
quantity less,1
"Been here for the first time. The food and the beer was great. Had ordered the white high pitcher, mutton kheema kothu parotta, basil chicken tikka and three cheese mushroom. The beer had a hint of citrus and a subtle sweet taste. The kothu parotta was a melt in the mouth delicious and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The mushroom was crisp and served as the crunchy element. Our table incharge Keshav ensured that our orders were on time and we had a pleasant experience. Kudos to him. I highly recommend the place for the food, beer and ambience.",2
not at all tasty.. it was very spicy,0
curry is very bad,1
"Superb place. Awesome place. Awesome drinks and foods. The management and the stuff are very courteous.

Good customer service, they know our drinks and food before we can order that's the amount of customisation this place offers.

Nirjan was our server and he was absolutely amazing!!

Overall a 5 star place, for dates, friend's gathering, reunions and a lot more.",2
Hi had vomitings after having the food.,0
good,1
"Loved the food and ambience.. the staff was very courteous..would like to recommend our steward Makhan!! Extremely helpful and courteous..
I had ordered Devil's own (cocktail ), found the taste little confused , probably you can work on the cocktail taste ...my husband had ordered beer sampler and a glass of stout beer later which he enjoyed !! So no complaints on beer.keep the good job going !",2
"I got stomach ache. Too spicy, please mantain quality",0
good and tasty,1
Place to hang out with your friends.. Soothing music and great service. Loved it completely. Variety of beers and munchies goes great with beer.,2
"I ordered chicken afgani but I don't know what I got. It was mix curry of chicken and fish, smelling bad and seems un heigenic , packing was also very ordinary like street food Corner.",0
not so good test,1
Superb service and awesome food. Nice place for friends and family . Good ambience with a lovely music. Friendly staff. Creamy mushroom is too good,2
very less quantity waste of money and delivery time took 2 hours,0
To be fair.... this place may seem like a heaven to the non vegetarians. But I throng to this place only for 1 reason.... it's Irani chai. It's really good and I visit it only for that particular reason.,1
This place had become our Friday evening mainstay in Hyderabad. Food is awesome and the brewed beer is a must have. Usually we have apple cider along with Burmese parcel which is absolutely amazing. Service is also really good.,2
"I have had the worst food from this restaurant
.. I ordered twice from this restaurant and both the timed the food was pathetic. I couldnt eat the stuff both the times..
Hotel Zara",0
not bad,1
"Decent place. We went there on a Saturday night and while we were disappointed with most restaurants not allowing a kid, this one didn't let us down. We ordered 2 veg platters which were truck load filling. We couldn't eat anything more! Also ordered their apple cider beer and white high beer. Decent enough. Also wanted to try the moonlit one. But were sad to know that it wasn't available. Service was the best over all things said above! Mr Sarveshwar was quick to all our requests being made and had great suggestions to give! The sole reason why this review has a 4 rating instead of a 3 or 3.5. Only thing a lil lull about the experience was that they had stopped the music midway. So, that dropped our moods and spirits a lil! Wish the restaurant had it going till the end!

Ambience - 3.5/5
Food - 4/5
Price- 3.5/5
Service- 5/5",2
"After all confirmation and payment, this restaurant has canceled my order while I had no other option to get food.
I'm unsatisfied with this restaurant.",0
worst hospitality they don't even have time to talk to us.,1
Nice place and food is outstanding. Service is very good. American Ale is very good. Vietnamese rice bowl and boti kebab tastes authentic. Niranjan service is very nice.,2
"I came there with my friend as stags. It was written stags are allowed till 8 pm but the reception person was unkind to say ‚Äúyou are not allowed ‚Äú at 7:45. He was looking down on us just cause there was no girl. The other point that he raised was that my friend was not wearing shoes. It looked reasonable.
Overall, it felt humiliating and I felt it wasn‚Äôt a decent place to even receive you.",0
average,1
"Actually I struggled between 3 and 4 for this place, where drinks are so good and buffet doesn't last to it. But a totally classy atmosphere in buffet area and very good vibes in first floor and their brewery is one of the best. A little costly. Caution: if you are a stag majority of times they won't allow u on ground floor in evenings, which is kind of sucks though. Finally value for money for a date or with a team else little expensive",2
Most terrible place. I used to love Chennai 10D And with that brand I went to Hyd 10D. Firstly they took cover charge for a couple and they had no seats. Could have told us we have no seats we would not have paid cover charge. We stood for good 20 mins and then given bad seats near the speaker where one couldn't even talk! And then the waiters weren't serving us food properly. Had to ask them twice after whicj they took order and when they did they didn't give us cutlery. Can you even imagine??? I had to ask that give forks !!!!!!! I had the worst experience ever of going to a place. Extremely disappointed. Please learn how to manage a crowd. Also I wanted to book my table beforehand. But the option was not even available on Zomato and they won't pick up call. It just felt they didn't want things to be systematic. Extremely disappointed.,0
A place for a better and Spicy Biryani in Gachibowli. Better than Paradise. Worth to taste and have Biryani with Thumbs up! Happy Eating.. The restaurant will not be crowded and one also cannot feel that ambience. Better to take a parcel from this place...‚ò∫Ô∏èüëçüëÜ,1

good,1
A good place to hangout with friends. Good ambiance. Good food. Great music.alsp good outdoor seating. Staff was very well and polite. Kundan served us very well and was very professional.,2
Ambience is good. But quality of food not up to the mark. Good place with family and friends wth music and all. Most pathetic cocktail i ever had,0
"Hello everyone ! We visited this place a few days back and tried their buffet . We were not happy with the quality of food served. The variation was good enough. There were 2-3 veg as well as non veg starters. The main course also had 2 veg and non veg dishes each . But the taste was not at all satisfying. We expect this place will improve in future ! üòä

If what you read is in any way helpful for you , do like the review and follow us ! We would be happy to bring in honest reviews about different restaurants all across India ! üòÉ",1
"Awesome place to hang out at. Kundan provided great service. Must visit. Try the food, especially Chana Dal Poori. Soothing music and nice ambience.",2
"Definitely one of the worst places to go for food.....If you order pasta oligo e olio, you get veggie noodles (yes, not even spaghetti) and the server tries to convince you that's it's what the dish is meant to be.....And you order chicken steak...You get a stale lump of so something covered in a sauce that's possibly cooked and stored for days...... Dangerous to go there.",0
We had buffet for dinner...its not bad.....But not too gud.....not worth for money.....Taste is just avg...and food items are less...best for just one time vist..,1
"I went with my friends. The apple cider beer is a must try. In the starters the 3 cheese layer mushroom, the Burmese wrap is also a must try in starters. Pizza was good the crust could have been little crunchy. Pasta was ok. Ambience is nice. The dj did not play the latest songs but the floor was filled with people. The waiter (Sarvesh) was courteous.",2
"I had gone for lunch a few days back and no doubt the place and food is amazing but I was not given the dessert which was included in the platter and the staff is always looking at you while you're eating, until you finish.
2 stars for food and ambience respectively but for the service they provide, I'm not at all happy with the place.",0
Have visited this place with colleagues for team lunch as they offer buffet & located in Gachibowli. Ambience & food was okish. 3 ratings for the service & staff!,1
"Do ask for Makhan if you visit, great service & good beer. Fermentation smell can get some people uneasy but beer lovers will surely appreciate.",2
"My friend and I visited this place on the 13th Of january around 1920 hrs and ordered your strong ALE, we believe that the beer was coughed into and we both fell severly sick with a scratchy throat and dry cough. I dont know why dont your employees wear a mask when on duty because I do not think I will ever return to you guys and this was my second trip to you and the second trip made me fall sick. I will spread it like wild fire for others before they fall sick, I can understand only one person falling sick but both falling sick with the same symptoms after consuming the strong Ale beer then there is something definiately wrong and I am certain that the beer we were served was unhygienic or was contaminated beacsue on my visit on the 8th of Jan I never fell sick with the strong Ale it was on the 13th that my friend and I fell sick . Second, ever heard of loose tobacco cigarettes? Your staff would stand on my head to make sure I am not smoking pot and are you serious?? I use fresh tobacco like American Spirit and roll my cigarettes and never expected this kind of survelance upon rolling a cigarette and taking my loose tobacco original pouch packing to smell that it is not pot, I feel humilated. Train your staff on hygiene and educate them.


PS: My First visit was on the 8th Jan and just FYI across the globe beer sampling is not chargable hence they are called samples.",0
"Ordered dragon chicken - 3/5 .sweet in Taste. And chicken pieces are hard to chew
Paneer 65 and paneer majestic are good in taste but softness of paneer is underdone
Rotis and butternans are very good here
Mughlai chicken - not so spicy but tasted good
Chicken fry piece biryani - totally disappointed as the chicken was fried too much and biryani rice is okay in taste
Sides are good

Ambience is quiet bright and friendly
Staffa nd service are good
Price s of dishes is reasonable",1
"Lit ambience,loud music and great beer. Apple cider is probably the best in town. Service is a little slow coz of the large croud. Perfect for an outing with friends on weekends.",2
Very rude staff. Ask them for corporate discount and they will ask you to cancel your reservation. Such a pathetic thing to say to any customer!,0
"The buffet here costs Rs. 399 for both Veg. & Non Veg. but it finishes before it even starts. Limited options are there, hence didn‚Äôt like it much. Preparation is fine, the crowd is average, ambience is like a normal restaurant. If you are strapped, then only visit it.",1
"Ambience of the place is amazing with good music. They have three types of seating arrangements, inside, lobby and open space. All options are good. Book the place in advance to avoid any hassle as the place remains crowded specially during weekends. Hospitality of the place is also very good. They serve the food nicely and even though the place was over crowded, they made sure to ask about the experience of the customers.

Apple cidar is one of the best brewed beer I have ever tasted. The alcohol content is appropriate and not at all bitter. Must to try at this place. Froscher is another good brewed beer.

Veg dimsums had great taste with stuffing of spinach, corn and cheese. It was served with three different kinds of dips. One of the dip was spicy, one had a taste of honey and last one was green chilli dipped in white vinegar. Chur chur with paneer bhurji with onion rings and palad is the perfect combination for all North Indian food lovers. Though the naan wasn‚Äôt chur chur, it was plain naan. Paneer bhurji was cooked well that brings out the taste of North India. The best starter was Burmese parcel with sweet chilli sauce. It was extremely good in taste.

If you are in Hyderabad, I will highly recommend to visit this place.",2
"Meh!!! Straight up. Heard from a friend that this is apparently rated the best pub in Hyderabad, but living in bangalore for 25 years and Boston for 5, this place is way over priced to start! Food is good don't get me wrong, but this place is clearly taking your money for the service and ambience which is so genuinely ""Meh""! For example asked for a bottle of water which apparently takes about 20 mins",0
The place is quite good but the entrance to the place is quite shabby. Late service. Place is busy. Food is actually good. Wait time for the food is actually high.,1
Parthu was awesome towards my guests he gave me the service I was looking for...thank for your warm service which is beyond and above what I excepted...,2
The only positive thing of the place was the ambience and atmosphere! We ordered nachos which was not served with salsa sauce . The mocktails were good enough but the barbequed paneer tikka was just horrible. It tasted like it was stale and was loaded with a lot of spice !,0
"Not a great dinner I had in the last night, ordered tikka biryani √†nd dum Biryani . Less masala and quality is bit of low. Ambience was okay",1
Such nice place to hangout with friends with live music and enjoy the brewery drinks and waiters were so friendly and approachable .. cheers üç∫,2
"I have always loved the TDS chain. Been to Kolkata, Bhopal and Hyderabad. But hyderabad has been the worst experience ever.Very bad service. We had to wait for long hours for the food to be served. No one was bothered even about the bill.",0

too much salt,1
OTM - food awesome...Lager awesome..ambience awesome.. I am frequent to Prost and any place which can be at par with Prost is you guys..only one area where you can improve is your staffing..upskill them as what all do you have in your menu..when I asked them suggest me the best risotto you have then he quoted sab same hai like Kichdi..so hope you look into it and add cheese cake in your dessert menu (the proper one).,2

Rate is a bit on the higher side,1
If you are a fan of brewery u should visit this place. I have tasted three of there beers they taste good. Food is very nice we ordered chicken and tandoori fish style murgh everything is perfect here. Serving is also fast. Zomato gold is additional bonus. I felt they should allow stags on weekends on upstairs at least with a entry fee. Rest everything is perfect.,2
Food was good and the service was too slow we wait for 25 minutes but no one come on out table for the order oftet when we talk with manager he was also with full of attitude. Over all rating 2*,0

Awesome service. Food and drinks especially the lunch concept if pretty cool here. Love Keshav for his service and hospitality! Try the lager beer,2
Ordered Chicken manchuria dry and biriyani... chicken was completely dry... it was not at all moist and manchurian taste was not at all induced into it... ordered full sent me half.... biriyani was like a spicy pulao... plz understand the difference between biriyani and pulao,0
"Approach to the hotel could have been better (on the top floor of an old building with smelly ground floor), location could have been better (not very visible from the outside), lift could have been better (pretty old lift, not sure if it passes safety norms), ambience inside the restuarant could have been better (doesnot give you a good vibe)! Thats about the appearance and appeal. Spread was decent for a discounted price of 400 per person inclusive of all taxes, food was ok as well. I could see a lot of smiling faces (familes) and that sums it all. If food is good, then nothing else should matter I guess.",1
"Nice brew to hang out, serving us really fast should thank Partho for it. Next to highway is the only the negative stand for this. limited choice for vegetarians. Non-vegetarian is really good.",2
"Worst thing I got 4 dinner, I ordered Full grill it was not all grilled unable to eat also Full like a flesh the worst grill in my life I hate",0
delivery very late more than 30 min,1
"Excellent food and service. Niranjan and Karunakaran made our day.

Nice tender chicken and German wheat beer. Uttar wonderful place for hangout.",2
Worst biryani they mix normal rice in biryani more than basmati. Ordered fish biryani and it tasted pathetic. It was the first time I ordered and IL make sure not to order or visit such a disgusting place ever again.,0
"We had picked up Sambar rice to satiate the craving for sambar daal. 
The dish was quite spicy to our tatse but tasted heavenly with curd as side dish. pretty easy on pocket too!",1
"The place is awesome. Ambience is great. Food, beer is just the best. And the best part is service, especially Niranjan guy is very kind and polite.",2
Response from hotel is ‚Äúkhaana hi to kha nai to ja‚Äù AC doest work in summer and even server behaves as if hez the owner of hotel. Doesn‚Äôt recommend for dine in here.,0
Nice Andhra style spicy food in decent price. Please don't visit of you don't like spicy food.keema biryani and prawn biryani ar highly recommended.,1
"Over the Moon is a brewery where you get a lot of beer to try from. We tried the apple cider(3/5), stout (4/5) and two others ( think one was called moonlit) (5/5) which were pretty good. The food was superb as well. We had the Burmese Parcel (5/5), Nachos (5/5), French Fries(2/5), Prawns (5/5), Chicken Kebabs(5/5), Chicken Poppers (5/5) and Mutton Kebabs(5/5). The place jas good music and later in the night people can dance. Overall an amazing experience in Hyderabad, which seemed to cover everything.",2
"Today i ordered panneer and roti . but not satisfy with food test . panneer 65 it's test not good , it is very dray . it's need to improve cooking.",0
"I had ordered food from Kritunga many times to my office and had visited this place once(Gachibowli). The ambience here is good and the staff was attentive.
The steward recommended ragi sangati and brinjal curry, it was very delicious. I also tried gongura chicken it was fine. Apart from these I tried spl chicken biryani, kamju biryani and chicken pulav through delivery. Overall i would say the food here is good, a bit spicy though and one can find a lot of chillies.
Packing could be improved as i found alot of polythenes in delivery order, it would great if the food could be packed in boxes.",1
Makhan provided really good service. Must place to go. Must try is belgian beer and stout. Chicken platter is good and fries platter is good to go for vegetarian,2
Not so polite staff. Many things that we wanted to have were not available. Except Biryani everything was not so good. Don't try double ka meetha,0
Food was bad. The paneer pieces in biryani taste is worst. Not satisfed,1
"One of the best restaurants visited till date in HYD. The have amazing ambience, delicious food and extremely courteous staff.
They are pro at making all the different delicacies and try to make sure that the customer walks out satisfied.
It is a must visit restaurant and has amazing North Indian food specially Dal Makhni and Paneer Butter Masala. The desserts are also amazing. All in all complete value for money.",2
To the management : Please be careful while packing. I ordered Tandoori roti and got Rumali roti instead.,0
it's spicy good. we want more tasty,1
"Special occasions call for unique celebrations accompanied by some fantastic fare. Dinner last night at Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf was one such memorable experience. Spread across an acre, with multiple dining sections carved around the garden courtyard it transports you to the coast. We choose to sit in one of the Mangalore tiled pavilions with mist fans and earthy furniture.

Now coming to the food, started with the masala fried prawns marinated in toddy vinegar. Accompanied by these soft paos the prawns with a hint of tanginess were one of the best I have had in recent times. Chicken xacuti with boneless chicken pieces wrapped in a robust spices was scrumptious and went very well with both the tandoori roti and the pao. Goan style coconut base fish curry which came along with rice was enjoyable but not exemplar.  

Sweet ending with the classic bebinca along with vanilla ice-cream  to complete the meal. The setting, food, and moreover the gracious service made it a top notch experience for us. After redemption of the Zomato Gold offering we paid 1474 for three adults and one child",2
"Beginning experience with pakwan grand is really good, but now a days they unable to satisfy customer needs and are providing bad quality of food",0
chicken was not boiled,1
Undoubtedly the best restaurant in Gachibowli. Get a fresh fish masala . You will love it for sure.Sit at the roof top and enjoy nicenbreezy air and feel of Goa,2
They given normal chicken meat by marinating that I was ordered grilled chicken .worst grilled I ever tested .please ever try at this resturent,0
very very spicy,1
"If your a lover of seafood and Goa's vibes and charm, this place is definetly a must try, a good Weekend option for a lazy lunch.
They have a huge variety of sea food cuisine, live counters, live music, a bar section, lots of activities for kids and ofcourse the elders too, the vibes of this place will make you fall in love with it.
Ps: choose the outdoor seating for a lively atmosphere, ofcourse have the weather of hyderabad in mind too depending on the season.",2
"Never ever order grill chicken and rumali roti from this place.Served a half cooked chicken and damn cold and old rumali roti. The chicken was pathetic, I hope i dont get food poisoning. Too bad. Even the onion were damn stale.",0
"very fast delivery and food quality was better
i ordered 2 biryani but salon was spoiled and i didnot get onions and lemon.",1
"This place is very huge and rustic and gives you the real Goa vibe. You sure would get amazing non veg and sea food but they have good veg options as well and in my five to six visits to this place I have covered the entire vegetarian menu. It‚Äôs mouth watering and delicious.
They also have live music on Friday s",2
"Noodles packet was having too much oil, it poured around 50-100ml oil.. too bad
Fried rice was taste less",0
"It is a great place for a quiet dinner and ambience is lovely but the food was a disappointment.
the place doesn't feel like we are inside the noisy city which is absolutely delightful, but I wish I could say the same about the food and drinks!!
staff is courteous and serving time is excellent, you don't have to wait for your food or drinks for more than 10-15 mins no matter what you order.

"On a Sunday evening, my wife got some serious cravings for sea food. So the first name that came to my find was ""Fisherman's Wharf"". On my last trip to Goa, I had the opportunity to visit their outlet near Mobor beach(South Goa). I won't say that I had an awesome food experience, but I was blown away by their ambiance! Although they have opened an outlet in Hyderabad, for quite sometime , but somehow we were yet to visit. So on Sunday 19th May, 2019, it was time for redemption. We visited the place around at 8:30 pm in evening , and by just watching the sheer numbers of cars parked, I could figure out that it was a full house!

Ambiance
===========
At the reservation table, we were courteously greeted. Then we were taken inside and had our indoor seat at ""Panjim"" restaurant. We would had loved an outdoor or upper deck seats, but unfortunately all were reserved! Starting from decors, live music, the lighting, well all I could say was that place was lively! The ambiance may not be as good as their South Goa outlet, but its not lagging that far, either! Ratings - 4/5.

Service
===========
As we were seated indoors at the ""Panjim"" restaurant, Himanshu was in-charge of our table. He was polite , courteous and efficient.  He was prompt in taking the order for us and the food came literally in no time. Top-notch! Ratings - 5/5.

Food
===========
Ta-da, here comes the big deal! My wife had prawn curry rice and I had fish and chips.   The prawn curry had thick gravy, prepared with coconut milk and Goan spices and tasted yum!  It was served with steamed rice. For the fish and chips fillet, well the size of the fillets was really generous and tasted really well. It was served with tarter dip! I was really impressed with the food, and now that we can get the coastal flavors  here in Hyderabad, is a pure bliss! Ratings - 4.5/5.

Value for Money
=============
Hmm, its a very important point! Is the food served, worth the price? Absolutely yes! My bill was just around a thousand bucks for the amazing dinner, and I am not complaining! Ratings - 4/5.

Lets calculate,

Rating = (Ambiance + Service + Food + VFM)/4 = 4.375

Final Thoughts

============= 
If you love live music, Goan shack kinda experience and good sea food, then its a must visit! Probably one of the best place to chill out in Hyderabad.",2
The taste of chicken 65 was very bad no soup & not at all hot worst taste I expected more but 1% also not reached to my expectations can you improve more,0
"Surprisingly the Sunset was an eye fiest. Evenings can be well spent. Feels like not in the City anymore. Quite peaceful and lovely ambience ü§©
Food is little disappointing though. Chicken is not at all spicy. But the Apricot Delight is a must try.
Go....have the most of the place with an Apricot Delight is what I can give 5/5 üòõ",1
"One of the best fine dining restaurant in Hyderabad . Superb ambiance and great service. I personally loved the place and the way they treat .

Tried spring roll, Tempura squid ,Drums of heaven and fish nam prik pao. Fish tasted awesome. Overall starters were great and you will not be disappointed.

Coming to main course ,tried mixed veg pulao and Dak bungalow chicken. Pulao could have been better. One more problem is you need to pay for raita or gravy to go with pulao.

Overall one will enjoy the ambiance and food. Better to have a reservation during weekends.

"This food is very worst I have no words to Say this is too much yach , you people are like begger for money and also I want to let you know that I am never going to order from you soon",0
"I went there with my office colleagues. The ambience is good. The music played is little loud, may be volume can be reduced a bit so that we do not need to about while speaking.

About food, quality of food is good, but waiters need to be taught that when four people order two different dishes, all those to be served at same time. What happens was, we two finished out veg food and the nob veg waa not even delivered when we finished our veg food.

We ordered Lotus stem Galouti, the taste of Galouti was good, but keeping one small kulcha was not going well. I know it must be an experiment, but I guess it is not working out as it was not going well with Galouti.

So, overall, good for one time.",1
Food is great here. Surprisingly even veg food was good. we ordered variety of veg and non veg starters and food was simply awesome. Their staff is very coordial too. Live music and the goa feel adds to lot of fun. I believe the photographs talks itself for amazing ambience they have to offer.,2
"Ordered from Zomato, very bad Rotis, were made of Maida, half baked. Rotis were having an unpleasant smell (don't know what was that). Had to dispose off and order from different resturant. Very bad experience",0
"great feel, great ambianceterrible customer serviceU need a mesh and anti mosquito repellents ASAPwould not really want to be back after such an experience here
the food was decent though",1
"Great ambiance, its a theme from Goa but I'd say its better than Goa itself.
The food was amazing, the service was great, and everything was organized.
My favorite dish out of all would be their pasta.

Would definitely love to visit again.",2
This place is worst.. biryani worst than ever... no quality of rice and not at all good ingredients.. worst biryani ever I eated. Worst worst worst.,0
"I have been to this for Saturday night dinner. The ambiance and the locality makes it a pleasant sit out with lush greens and golf court all around. The only thing which disappointed me is the service, which was very very slow and the response was not up to the mark.",1
"Goan themed restaurant with great picturesque view and vastly spread. Great place to chill all around the day. The price is a bit on the higher side.
Ordered Zafrani Paneer tikka , amritsari fish tikka and butter garlic prawns for starters. Fish tikka was okayish, paneer nice and the prawns were delicious.
Tried thai green chicken curry with Jasmine rice for main course along with butter/garlic naan, daal tadka and paneer butter masala. Loved the thao curry.
They offer multiple options in cocktails and mocktails, however the prices are a bit high on the pocket. Had the best long island ice tea till date.
All in all a great experience.",2
Worst Biryani I have ever tasted..... Experience was not at all good.. Staff is also not so cooperative.. Ambience is also not that good.. Okayish..,0

"I have been there with my family. Mainly the ambiance and appetizers are just amazing.
Another main asset of the restaurant is the way there are presenting the food.",2
"Wost Biryani I ever had from here today. I know, it was late when I ordered for 'Paneer Biryani' but the delivery I received was absolutely unexpectable.
It was a plain rice with Butter Paneer Masala at the end, seriously I was shocked when I opened the package.
Last time, I ordered 'Veg Biryani' which was also just accpetable.
So, from my past experience food from this place is totally non-recommendable, specially for vegiterians.
Pakwaan Grand team, guys plzzz",0
"We went there to celebrate my husband's birthday given the ratings we saw. However the restaurant did not live up to the high expectations, considering the average food and slow service. The staff was courteous though as we did not like our tomato soup, and they were prompt enough to take it back. Honestly, the replaced one wasn't much of a relief either. Would recommend there to go for the evening view with friends for few drinks, but don't expect mu h beyond that!",1
"Excellent ambience, great food and service... There starters, desserts and mocktails are absolutely delicious. The main course is above average. That's what makes this place a 5 star fine dining restaurant. They have different sections both open and covered and named under Goan beaches. They have a fresh catch section, from where you can choose fishes, crabs and lobsters and ask them to prepare it.",2
Worst experience. Grilled chicken was spoiled. First I thought it was not cooked well but I realized that foul smell is coming and the chicken is not at all fresh.,0
"Unique location with tranquil seating outside.
Food is very average despite being fusion 9 offshoot.
Drinks average plus. Overall didn‚Äôt understand the hype",1
"Goan food at its best! This place is as good as it's sister outlet in Goa. Mimicking the Goan ambience, this place is breezy and beautiful for an evening dining experience.

The food had great flavours, brilliantly cooked juicy prawns and the coconut sambol like side just tingle your taste buds. The southern fish fry and masala fried prawns are a delight! Great lighting and courteous staff.

Tried the south indian fish curry and rice. Probably not the best I've had, but all the other dishes made up for this.

Must try: masala fried prawns, kadhai jhinga, mutton xacuti, pinwheel delight (mushrooms)

Would give it a 4.5/5 just because of the prawns!",2
"Ordered Mushroom Curry from Pakwaan Grand via zomato. The worst chicken non veg curry , with no chicken ke naam par ek bons How can anyone serve piece First & last time, no more ordering.",0
The food is great over here.. we are sort of regular over here as its nearby to our office campus.. One can try the combos over here which have a great potion.. mocktails are good but expensive..,1
The ambience is really good. The food is good and especially the starters are delicious. Butter prawns were the best. We were given a great service by Mr Naveen. Would definitely recommend this place.,2
I ordered special mutton biryani in pakwan. The biryani is oily and full spicy. I hope the biryani is afternoons one. Pieces are not boiled and very bad experience with pakwan grand. Please appoint a good chef üò†üò†üò†,0
Had ordered veg lasagna and enchilada for home delivery. The lasagna was good but after taste wad not that great. Enchilada was more like an Indian preparation. Could be better.,1
"One of the best places to chill in Hyderabad after a long week‚Äôs hard work. Love the place, the ambiance reminds of Goa and the food definitely yes. I love the prawns and the sea food, especially the butter friend prawns and the prawn Balchoa. The drinks added for the flavour, I would recommend for a nice evening, but check the reservations before hand, the first time I went had to wait for more than 25 mins. Service is great. Overall a 5 star rating.",2
Food was good But services is not good because in restaurant have mobile network issue so i have some urgent work in my mobile and i asked the dine in admin they simply sad they don't about WiFi password .... Even I m regular customer .... very disappointed .üòêüòê,0

"Good for a nice Sunday brunch. The buffet for two is 1500 INR, and worth the deal, I'd say. The ambience is also great and you do get a lot of seating options. Would recommend.",2
Chicken biryani home delivery open the packet Very bad service not satisfied test is very good lekin no hygienic very very bad home delivery chicken biryani test very good please next time not reply,0
"Among all the dishes I have tried there, Cottage steak was the one which stood well for me. They serve this with cottage tikki, barbecue sauce (which was going really well in combo).
Veg burger was just fine, not really worth trying.",1
"This place makes you feel like you are at the shore of a beautiful beach in goa, sipping on your favourite drink and just taking the whole feeling. Designed to make you feel like your on vacation, it ticks all the right boxes for a foodie like me. Different sections of the restaurants are named after various places in goa,making it a perfect place to feel like you are on a vacation. We had the potato rechado which was spicy and very flavourful.Mushroom tonak and Mix veg foogath with vegetable pulao was our main course which we enjoyed as well. It is the place if u want to try goan cuisine.",2
"I was ordered egg biryani but I was found a chicken piece in egg biryani how iam eat now , The restaurant people is such a worst people nd west restaurant in That area !!!!",0
"Food is good and ambiance too, just that we ordered for Pasta for my kid with no spice and it was loaded with black pepper which was not a pleasant experience. Staff is a bit rude may be because they are not well staff.",1
"Perfect place for corporate dine outs. Had a great time with my team dinner. Wide variety of Goan dishes and other food as well as ""beverages"". A bit expensive but OK. The private space was good at 'Margarita lounge'",2
I'd ordered chicken biryani a couple of times before because it was good. However this time it was very disappointing. It was a piece of dry chicken with dry rice with no masala at all.,0
"When you hunt for nice place.. and meet folks who are just busy in their own.. it‚Äôs a let down..

Staff really needs to pickup on the service and behavior..
not at all a nice experience
Food saved this place the 3 star.. coz it was tasting decent..( not great again..).

Not willing to visit again..( would give 2.5 if had a choice)",1
The best place in Hyderabad. Ambience is par class. Food is nice and service is always nice. I love the live music too. I love love love it. Crowd is managed well.,2
"Ordered grill chicken from zomato... must say.. never had more pathetic grill chicken in life... The chicken was so hard , couldn't try more than one piece",0
Have visited deli 9 many times with good experiences but this particular time didn‚Äôt have the same. I ordered Singaporean prawns for starters. As I was using Zomato gold the waiter insisted a place orders for both the dishes together which I haven‚Äôt heard anywhere before. After some question the waiter agreed. The quantity of the prawns were underwhelming although the raat was good. Then ordered chicken lasagna which is a safe bet here along with cold coffee. Overall the service disappointed me but its a good shot for some good food,1
"Little Goa is what this place is.
the feel itself took me to goa in a jiffy
great place to chill with friends and colleagues
the seletion of items on the menu is epic
pork beef and seafood in the same restaurant in hyderabad is wonderful
this is my go to place in hyderabad now",2
ordered for special mutton biryani which is very bad the rice is over cooked and it's like khichdi,0
"Okay, so I really get agitated if the coffee that I order doesn't meet my credentials .

I don't think they understand the ingredients of the type of coffee that you order.coz I had asked for a strong cappuccino and what was offered was more on the terms of a milky latte.

The food, well I had ordered pav bhaji which was again okayish.I don't know how the keema pav tasted though.

All in all, this place isn't that great when you compare with other cafes in the town.",1
A very good to place to Dineout with friends. #feltlikeGOA. Awesome ambience with sweet live music and delicious food. #hangoutwithbesties.

"arey idiot, you have given chicken biriyani. I ordered mutton biriyani. what the hell are u doing there ?",0
"More is not always merrier, hot dog with lettuce and tomatoes was tasting more like a sub sandwich, although after removing the veggies it tasted really nice.

Home style potato wedges were a good attempt but a little too bland.

Penne pasta was overcooked but the sauce had not soaked in all flavours hence tasted a undercooked.

Best part was the desert, old fashioned pastry which was not too sweet and not too chocolate.

Overall experience was goodsince the staff is very considerate and ambience is very comforting",1
This is a nice place. Food and cocktails are great. On the expensive side but its worth it for the feel good factor. Great service by the team and management.,2

"Deli 9 Bistro is in front of Holiday inn express and suites hence becomes a perfect fit to order some dinner.

I have ordered one Veggie 9 burger and tried Shawarma wrap and Deli 9 Bistro garden veg pizza in the restaurant it self.

Veggie 9 burger - 3.5/5
Deli 9 Bistro garden Pizza -4.5/5
Shawarma wrap - 3/5

Pizza was very good .It was a thin crust pizza with cheese,sauces and veggies on top of it.
Burger had a Patty with cheese and some Vegetables like cucumber,tomatoes and onions.I found the burger pretty average.

With both burger and wrap,they give some wedges and salad complementary.When I ordered then as well as when I went to their restaurant,the wedges were cold and dry and they were disgusting.I can understand if it was only in the case when I ordered food but how can the restaurant give the customer who have come for dining already prepared wedges.That was seriously not expected from Deli 9 Bistro!!!",1
"We went with the team lunch it's lavish buffet at 999/- we like the sea food grilled and the staters and main course and desserts..

"Ya i Started with a starter what to say i ordered stuffed crab and its not spicy as i thought its not at all spicy adding pepper and salt gave more taste and its around 300 i guess and fish starter is also good and its spicy, yum and many pieces were given too.This hotel is famous for sea food.Thought its famous for sea food when i asked for lobster they could not able to provide and my suggestion is they can add more varities of sea food which are available in India too.I felt like limited edition of varities are a available here.then my tummy is full with 2starters and then came devils chocolate cake oh gosh its like a heaven for me and its around 280.This hotel gave a Goa touch they have buffet and everything and live music too.cocktails and mocktails are available too.The waiters were also dressed in the theme of beach and good place to take pictures also.

"Frio is set in a dark toned theme with black walls and complementing prismic mirrors with dim lighting to set mood for a quiet, interesting evening conversation.
The music is contemporary and thankfully not too loud. It moulds into the environment without intruding into your private space.
Service was fine. We had to keep a lookout for waiters rather than them looking out for us, but were courteous and friendly.
Here is what we ordered:
100% arabica cold coffee - basic and just right. Creamy and not too sugary.
Dark chocolate shake - absolute yum and sinful. It tastes exactly as you would want it to. The only ask - since it's categorized as thickshake, it should be thicker, but I guess that's the case with shakes served anywhere in the city.
Chicken ala plancha - Sheer dissapointment, especially given that it was in chef's special menu. It was as ordinary as ordinary can be. We ordered scallion rice on the side as the dish is incomplete without carbs. It's basically a tomato gravy with chicken and hardly any seasoning. Wouldn't recommend.
Lamb ravioli - It's a shame we don't get ravioli in most of the outlets across the city serving pasta. Even if they do, it's mostly vegetarian (spinach and ricotta cheese without exception). To our delight, Frio doesn't disappoint here. The ravioli is good (doesn't make it to my top 5 list), but still good. Ravioli was cooked well, herbed garlic bread on side was great and so was the tomato gravy.
We couldn't get to dessert as we ordered our food during the final order (20 mins before closing), but I have heard that their tiramisu is great.
All in all, Frio is a good place to visit. In terms of food, you could love or let's say not love the place basis what dish you ordered. I won't be a frequent here, but wouldn't mind going back for another try either. Happy dining!",1
Went there as a group of 10 for lunch buffet. The place is easy to find and at the entry you have an option to choose either AC or outside. because of the heat we went inside. The starters and soup were served on the table. There were numerous starters and it was very good. the starters actually make you full. The waiters were very friendly and helpful. they had asked multiple times for the starters to be repeated. the main course was good and there was a huge spread there. the best part was the desserts which were awesome. Next time would like to go on a evening for the outdoor seating and ambience.,2
its not biryani. its plain rice mixed with some masala..I have ordered from this restaurant earlier but this time it is horrible.,0
"I'm reviewing a delivery order.

I've ordered spaghetti aglio e olio from this place.
It was soaking in oil and very less quantity.

The packing seemed like it was done in a hurry with minimum care. No spoon/fork and tissues were given with the pack.

I really liked the way they didn't backout when it came to adding olives and cherry tomatoes. Keeping the oil aside, the taste was good. However, there is scope for improvement because I've read good things about this place and their food. Didn't expect it to be like this.",1
"Great place to have seafood in Hyderabad, Goan style. Beautiful ambience. Lovely live music. Must visit place for food lovers. Overall great experience. Will visit again. Service was quick and friendly.",2
Wrong Order Received,0
"I was at this bistro for dinner with my friends recently on a weekday.
Ambience was decent. It was a tad too dark for my liking, but the spacious table setting and the gentle hit tracks playing in the background made up for a nice dinner setting.
Service was pretty decent. The waiter who attended our table was courteous and prompt in serving.
The food was a big disappointment though. Of all the dishes we ordered, few starters and the tiramisu cake were the only saving grace. Main course (Spinach ravioli, Belly dance pizza, Stuffed chicken breast and Greek chicken sovlakhi) was a total disaster. Not a single person from our group of 6 could find anything tasty from this bunch. We finished the meal off with tiramisu and dbc cake, which was good and filling.

Overall, an average restaurant. If you‚Äôre looking for good Italian, this is not the place to be. CIBO house is.",1
"The Ambience of this place is amazing. As the place is usually away from the city there's a sense of calm. Wanted to try seafood in hyderabad and i guess this was the best place available.
The only complaint is they have buffet lune up till Friday so the options for weekends are usually limited.",2
"In name of offer on Uber Eats, this restaurant is cheating with customers, using third class quality rice for biryani and no meat at all in mutton biryani, not even single piece, atleast rice should be good, that also full masala and full oily. Will complain to food inspection officials of GHMC, customers will get diseases by eating such kind of full masala biryani and low quality rice",0
"Food quality: 3/5
Ambience: 3/5
Service: 4/5
Whenever a menu of a restaurant is limited, we generally expect the taste to be phenomenon. Most of the things that we ordered were okay but the pasta had very thin sauce and also the pasta was not properly cooked.",1
"Been to this place couple of times but finally found time to share my review.
Great ambience with tasty food, more of the chicken was delicious and juicy.
One should also try the fries of this place.
Would recommend people to visit this place.
Best time to click photos at this place would be sunset time and want to hear good live music then the weekend is the best.",2
"I accept that the biryani was soon good. but the raita was stale and sour. As such reputed restaurant, they should look after quality",0
"Being rated well on zomato, I had expected it to be impressive, but the ambiance was just mediocre, food was again average.. didn't find anything special about it. Also, there are not really much options on the menu.",1
"Beutifull indoor and outdoor sitting. Delicious food.we ordered man how chicken soup . ok
Loose prwans was good. crispy chilly pork so yummy .service is good",2
"I ordered Kaju Panner biryani today. In Biryani, the pane-er is not fresh and predestined. The restaurant cooks are not cooking properly I think. need to change your  cooking  staff.",0
"They serve very small portions.. not at all worth the price. Service is good. Tried pizza, pasta, fiery chicken signature dish. None of that was above average. Taste and prices could have been better. Zomato gold can be redeemed here.

Giving extra star just for the service staff. They were helpful and prompt.",1
All kind of food is good here wrt al a carte. Go for famous dishes here e.g. crispy chicken. Not a disappointment for experimenting either. Dish of the day was not up to the mark sometimes. Pricey for regular visits.,2
"Thr place is good and the food was great, however the service was slow. In mutton biryani the mutton was half cooked which was a spoiler. At last we ordered mutton rogan josh and i took ages to be delivered, finally we had to cancel the order and leave.",0
"It was a funny experience there. While the main course is quite satisfying, the deserts were a total let down. The ground floor could definitely do with some ventilation, the fumes from the washroom will drive everyone away.",1
"Absolutely loved this place. Highly recommended.

Food: Delicious. Exotic. Hygienic. We tried lobster, prawns and red wine. We wanted to try crabs and other kind of wine but that was not available. Maybe they should keep the menu items in stock. You may not get all the items listed. 10/10

Ambiance: Beautiful. Live music. Great lightening. For parties and a nice dinner. 8/10

Service: Satisfied. They prepare food just like you would like it, asking for instructions. Waiters were polite and nice. They served us cake as we went for birthday celebration. It was just a pastry but still nice gesture. 8/10",2
We have ordered multiple times Mutton jumbo packs here at that time Biryani was good and tasty. But today's Mutton jumbo pack is worst and very spicy. Please check the parcels when you are delivering order.,0
"Been to this place last month. Quite a peaceful place not many people were there. We ordered some drinks and pizza and pasta. I somehow felt pizza could have been little better the taste was good and it was cooked properly. But there were literally no toppings except chicken. Pasta was clearly not upto the mark. I had given specific instructions which weren't taken care at all. Also, later during the billing there were some confusions on the gold membership. We did inform the staff at tge beginning that we have Zomato gold however not sure if that was well communicated to the management, because during the billing we were said that we should have informed about the gold membership earlier which we clearly did. But didn't quite understood whats the problem if it is not communicated at the beginning.. Do they charge differently for the gold membership people because they have offers??",1
The ambience tells everything. The place reminds of Goa. The must place for dinner. The food is tasty and they should try the Goan delicacies.,2
Bad food egg was smashed,0
"I would rate it 3-4 star. It is a mediocre restaurant with different cuisine.
Food was ok. First was minestrone soup, it did not have any exotic vegetables or pasta. Tangy taste was good. Mezze platter was average.humus was good while pita bread was not upto the mark. Thin crust pizza Farmers Orelanto was good. Had nice crust. among deserts, ordered for chocolate fondant, it was the best with right amount of sweetness.
Presentation of each and every dish was superb. Staff is polite. Good place for quiet dinner. Can improve on food taste though.",1
"Went here while I was on my trip to Hyderabad, the place is really huge.
Best things about this place: food, variety of drinks, dessert and fish.
Price Wise it's expensive, food quantity is great.
We're a bit late, but still they arranged proper food for us.",2
I ordered Rajma which turned out to be salty spiced water without any Rajma in it. Avoid the place because quality doesn‚Äôt seem to be given much importance.,0
"The place has a nice quiet ambience, I was surprised that it wasn't crowded as you'd expect a top place to be on a weekend.

We were ushered in well and we choose a nice cozy place, the place had a nice charm to it . We ordered the Tangy Grilled Mushrooms and the Glazed Pork Ribs, but the disappointing aspect of our visit though was we were rushed into placing the order. We came in at 10pm and we were told to place our last orders instantly, when I checked they said the place shuts down at 11pm and the last order was at 10:15pm.

Coming to food, the mushrooms seemed a bit too tangy but that's probably my palate , the glazed pork ribs were top notch and juicy and tender. Had it not been for the pushy waiters we would have liked to order drinks and a dessert too.

The waiters made sure that they cleared the plates in a jiffy and pounced on us with our last spoon handing us the copy of the bill and all of this before we even touched 11pm. Not that our intentions were to have a night out there but you don't actually liked to be rushed on your orders and food, it just doesn't leave a good experience, Possibly the restaurant and it's employees were planning on catching a flight and made sure nothing came in the way.

The rating is for the food and the place in general.Service is a bare minimum.",1
What a amazing place where I feel wow. Special pizza really yummy and wich is call classic mojito excellent.and music and service everything an overall excellent special thanks to Mr Rahul he is very politely I enjo my lunch .............üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëçüëçüëç,2
Place is a mess was shocked to see chaos the other day and i had an upset stomach after having the food from here there was total confusion i will never order from this place again n frank opinion it reminded me of hell sorry but i spoke my mind.,0
"Average food. I had cheese garlic bread, pizza and white sauce pasta. Cheese garlic bread was good, but pizza had lof oil in it and pasta had no sauce. It was a bit dry. Didn't like it much. Staff and ambiance were good.",1
"I was waiting since long to visit this place. One fine breezy evening I‚Äôve been here for dinner. Great spacious and open space to sit and chill for long. I can say great ambience to sit and relax near to outer ring road. Space is great, customer service was too good, food is delicious. Must try sea food space for fish ...

Service : amazing
Hygiene : 4

Worth visiting once more: Yes",2
The paneer paratha is not good as expected. It need to be improved. The paneer stuffed insided paratha is not seem to be fresh instead it look like worst paneer that I had eaten so far.,0
"Frio Bistro is located in Gacchibowli, below the Tilt. I went here with a couple of friends. I had ordered Belly dance pizza and ravioli. The pizza was damn good. Nice crisp crust and the toppings were perfect. But coming to the Ravioli, I was very disappointed. It had way too much pepper in it. And the taste of the sauce wasn‚Äôt satisfactory either.

Service: 4/5

Pizza: 5/5
Ravioli: 3/5

"Away from the city, set up at a perfect location, beautifully lit, essence of Goa lingers all over.
Sea food lovers this is the place for you amidst all the hills in Hyderabad.
Tawa fry Fish is a must try.
Service is fantastic.
Music is mostly great.
Ambience is hands down a winner and good food along with a perfect mix of cocktails.
Goan style dishes would take your taste buds literally to Goa.
Special occasions like Diwali and Holi are also welcomed here like home.
Family or friends fits in good for both.
Finding a place in the weekend could be time taking so recommend to pre book a table.",2
"1 : PATHETIC TASTE OF FOOD, IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.I  Ordered Rajma , Chapati and Rice and Rajma was too much salty aprox 10 times and same with raita too , i am sure if someone will make rajma blind folded still he/she can not make as pathetic as it was.
HIGHLY DISAPPOINTED.",0
"A sophisticated and calm place to eat. I'm a big fan of their Stuffed cheese steak (chicken breast stuffed with cheese and spinach, served with mashed potatoes and veggies). The sangria was not up to the mark and the chocolate shake was also average. I would definitely go there for their pastas and the stuffed steak.",1
"If you love goa... This place is nostalgic... It has sectons divided with the names of places in goa like panjim, colva, baga etc

You don't need to give a second thought to the ambience at all... Its perfect for a date or a group...

Good place to have corporate party...

Friendly staff...

Food is awesome veg as well as nonveg...

Must try... Chilli paneer , nachos, fried rice , chilli chicken, prawn

All the alcohol they mention in the menu is available so not to worry for that... even the beers...

Cocktails to try... Mojito, cosmo, mai tai, sangria ... These are what i tried and they are best....",2
"Outlet was once a treat for the Punjabi dishes, but over the period of time, the quality is going down and the so-called ‚Äògoooooddessst‚Äô taste has been missing the mark more than once.
Yesterday ordered for one portion of puri-choley and one portion of puri-alu. The puris were fat and oily. The alu curry was more like hing(asafoetida) Curry and had to dig through the gravy for choley. Our breakfast was definitely spoiled. In my last order of Rajma-chawal, same thing had happened. I really had to search for the rajmas in the gravy.
Wish the management will work upon the food quality. Because at this rate, they‚Äôre losing out on loyal customers.",0
We ordered Spinach and cheese cream ravioli and spicy tomoto pastas. Spinach and cheese cream ravioli was delicious but i expected it to be white sause pasta and it was red sauce pasta. Pit Master oizza was good. Cheese lovers was not so good it was thin crust and taste was awful.overall it was overpriced and taste was not very great but ok ok,1
"Had been here a couple of times. Nice ambience, lots of place to sit. Courteous Staff Members Wil want you to visit this place again. The food is also nice. I think we indian restaurants should start asking spice requirements so that we don't end up getting spicy food.",2
Very sad with the order. The youghurt/curd used to make the lassi was utterly sour. Somehow managed to drink and my stomach was upset. Please use fresh Curd.,0
"I really had high expectations for Frio Bistro. It'd been on my To-Eat list for a while. The food is average. We had a pasta, the Chicken & Sausage paella, and a cheesecake. Nothing was really sooo yummy/out of the world. And it was really costly. But the staff was courteous. However, I probably won't come here again",1
"I love sea food a lot and there are wide number of animals to eat üòÇüòÇ great ambiance, friendly staff. A non - vegetarian will enjoy this place for sure. Liquor prices are not goan prices üòÇ",2
half of the order was not delivered by the restaurant. and they didn't bother to pick the call for that,0
"Have been for lunch. Honestly speaking had a good expectations, but not really did the food satisfy my taste buds.

Soup ""Rustic Itallian Minestrone"" was a good start to begin with. Assuming something different it will be ordered ""Gacchibowli Fried Chicken"", only to realise it was another version of KFC Friend Chicken. This was little disappointing. And in main course ""Stuffed Chicken Breast"" was descent and not so out of the world taste but it's ok.

All in all descent ambience, ok food but service has to be improved a lot. For me for sure not a second time visit place, rest you can do try for sure you may be lucky and fortunate to get better taste of food.",1
"Fisherman's Wharf is basically Goan themed restaurant with a huge seating area. They have outdoor seating facility as well as indoor seating arrangement. They also have buffet area, pub area, rooftop area etc. The ambience is beautiful. Now coming to the food, we ordered

‚ñ™Ô∏è Jeera Rice
‚ñ™Ô∏è Zaffrani Paneer Tikka (Recommended)
‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Fry

"Just ordered Gobhi kulcha and daal makhani.
Kulcha, full raw from both sides and no pickle and onions provided.
Highly disappointed and will not prefer to order again as this is the 4-5th time this happened.
Many times I have been to that place and politely gave my feedback but it seems customer satisfaction is not their priority.",0
"Food was good. Service was great. The staff is super courteous. But the food didn't really make me go wow this is amazing. It was good, but then again, not out of this world. It's a great place to hang out. We had the bacon pizza, Alfredo pasta, and the prawn and fish paella. On a visit before that we had the mushroom risotto. The mushroom risotto was great! The bacon pizza can have a bit more of the pizza sauce on it. I didn't like the taste of the raw red pepper in the paella. Finished with hot chocolate which was amazing. Looking forward to trying a few other dishes there on the next visit.",1
Been to this place today for team lunch and this is my third visit. My experience from this Restaurant is that never opt for Buffet. Go for a la carte you will not regret.,2
"Do you guys understand the meaning of half and full quantity while you deliver food? How it affects the situation during lunch when the food delivered is incomplete and cannot be eaten by two, this 1* is to ruin my personal experience with you guys. As even the zomato CS was pathetic to resolve it",0
"I wish I could give it a 3.5 but don't have the option. Just for the record it deserves a strong 3 (closer to a 4).

We tried the Pizza, Chicken Breast stuffed with spinach, spaghetti followed by deserts.

The Turkish Pizza was the stand out dish for us (we did not expect that). The others were also very good and I would go again for sure.

The Tiramisu, although looked and smelled great was the biggest let down. The Bakhlava was just okay, not a bad attempt. The Cheese cake on the other hand was yumm...

Overall, I would recommend this place with a word of caution that it is on the expensive side. We ended up paying about a 1200 per head ...",1
"Food :4
Service:4

This is on the list for a long time and checked it off. Well it‚Äôs an Goan themed restaurant and they nailed the whole decor. Coming to food we went at 5:30 pm so not much of a choice in menu. So ordered fish fingers and chicken starter, both turned out good. Will definitely try again.",2
I havent got my order yet!!!,0
"Had a family lunch while on a visit to Hyderabad. Suggested by my son settled for the meal.

We went with the suggestion of the Steward, for starters had Mushroom on khari, turned out to be a good choice.
Son wanted to have lamb doner kebab in pita pocket. He was okay.

Spicy tomato arabitta turned out to be a tasteless flavour less offering. When we informed the Steward he got a fresh one made personally supervising. Turned out to be too saucy, no traces of parmesan cheese, probably it could have had few more pieces of the penne.

Finally the meal was concluded with a tiramisu. A bigger disappointment.",1
"The place is open seating, gives a good airy feeling. Music is good and it had occupancy on a week day.

We ordered catch of the day lobster & Pomfret, Fish was very ordinary, the lobster was done well. Main course was super, prawns fried were spicy and full of flavours. The star of the night was chicken caphreal looked like Palak Paneer at the first but had a distinct Goan flavour, spice on the higher side.

Nice place, I would suggest stick to the menu and avoid catch of the day!",2
Very bad packing of the food. It all got mixed with each other. Couldn't have the meal which I ordered. Pls make sure to pack properly when sending it for the delivery.,0
The snack items are nice. The pasta here is good. I have also tried the cupcakes which were also good just a bit too sweet. The ambience is very good and there is sofa seating available too.,1
"This has become my go to place now. We went on a Sunday evening, and really had a very good time with some delicious food and the band performing was also very nice. We ordered stuffed crab and I would say it is a must try dish. It was just mouth melting. In main course we had Goan prawn curry and rice and it was good. They also have fresh catch counter where you select and customize your sea food",2
did not give paratha as mentioned in menu,0
"Ordered one cake for my friend birthday. It was not what i thot, less cream and very bready cake it was . Not satisfied . Will try new soon.",1

worst. please stop selling chole bhature,0
It's a good chain of bakery here in the city well they give quite decent quality and quantity of food but only issue while ordering with Karachi bakery is the cheese burst sandwich french fries foot long get cold n looses the freshness for home delivery well I request to Karachi bakery to find an alternative for this ....,1
"Went here for lunch with friends given this was near our place. Had heard rave reviews so decided to give it a try. 

During lunchtime, the place had few patrons but the service was good. We took an outside seating. 

Ordered a nachos platter, chicken drums of heaven, tawa murg khatta pyaz and kadhai chicken. Accompanied with butter naan.

The nachos were crisp and came with delicious toppings of salsa and cream cheese. The chicken dishes were delicious and each had its own distinct taste. The chicken pieces themselves were quite chunky and juicy. We really liked chicken drums of heaven with its crunchy outer covering from the batter and juicy inside. 

Overall, the dishes were a must try. With a large menu and varieties, I know I'll be coming back here again for sure to try their signature fish, prawns, and lobster fare.

It's a huge restaurant with very spacious seating...they have outdoor seating, indoor seating, bar area,buffet area, roof top area its pretty huge place..and every bit of the restaurant is amazing.. Ambiance is spot on...waiters dress code is good too. Service is amazing. They have perfect knowledge of what they are serving..and always ready to help dinners. Hospitality is awesome. But Only one washroom is a mehüôÑ
Coming to the food..i tried many dishes like thai green curry,butter garlic fried rice, stuffed crab, fish and chips, alfredo pasta, cheez garlic bread.
I order thai curry every time I go..it comes with rice.. its creamy and fresh but the only reason i gave 4 star is they lack consistency...it tasted different all three times i tried.. It was good but different. Consistency matters!
Stuffed crab is amazing...overall must visit resturant. Its a expansive one but worth the visit..! I sujest night times around 7 is a good time to go.",2
Ordered Kadhi pakoda rice combo (Nov 2018). It was extremely bad. The rice seemed to be cooked with a lot of baking soda. Kadhi was awful to taste. Avoid this dish.,0
Nice,1
"I've been there with my girlfriend on a weekend, the ambiance was soulful. A bit expensive but the food was too good. The staff could be more professional and my girl enjoyed a lot i should say. Hitting the Gachibowli road for long ride? Do stop-by there....",2
Poori was very oily,0
The osmania biscuits are to die for so are their famous fruit biscuits. It gets overwhelming sometimes as they are large amount of different flavor biscuits. People should really try going to their main outlet.,1
"Been to this place on Wednesday evening for family dinner . On a weekday also the place was crowded.
The place is very spacious and there is not much to talk about ambience . It‚Äôs pretty simple . Service is at its best .
Ordered : Veg machow soup , fisherman wharf special soup , butter garlic prawns , masala fried prawns , fried fish , badami broccoli, Goan prawn curry , chicken wings, egg fried rice , curd rice. All tasted decently good except egg fried rice.
Must try : Badami broccoli , butter garlic prawns , chef special soup . These tasted extremely delicious and special mention about curd rice üëå",2

Poori with aloo curry.... Not at all good... Poori is like paratha and full of oil. Texture is very hard and curry with full of masala.... I had my worst breakfast,0
less quantity given,1

I have tried Irani Chai and Pasta Sandwich in Karchi cafe and the taste and not that great. I feel this cafe is really hyped and the taste didn't go According to my expectations,1
Should visit this place for dinner coz in summer you feel too much hot in afternoon that you can‚Äôt feel the taste of the food. Nice place for corporate team outing. Food was good and absolutely taste desserts first.,2
I agree... They provide food better than ordinary. But i would definitely not recommend people to order from here. They provided incomplete order which is ok... It can happen. But over that they were not responsible too... Their behaviour is very rude which is not professional. It sounded as if it's my fault not theirs.,0
Nice place to go for a casual snacks and smoothies. Rate is slightly higher but the food quality is okay. Dinning space is very good. One can seat outside watch the road and enjoy the food as well,1
"Hi guys,

I went here as part of an office party. So can't really comment about the Al Carte.

The ambience is really cool. Full Marks to these guys for replicating Goa in such a great way.

"I am giving a bad rating not to the restaurant but because of zomato... Everytime I order food the instructions are not properly relayed to the restaurant and I end up getting something which I can't eat(for example spicy or with onions). They simply refuse to cancel the order and even if I ping them separately everytime they say ""system gitch"" .. very bad delivery service by zomato. Zomato clearly doesn't care about it customers but may be they will listen to the restaurants may be because, due to zomato restaurant's name is going for a sale here...",0

A Goan themed restaurant with a bar attached has wide variety of sea food and the typical desserts of the west coast too. It is slightly expensive but it is totally worth the money. The look and feel takes you the coast and away from the city and all the noise. This place is for friends, family and your loved ones. They have good variety of appetisers. Their service is very friendly. They do have valet and ample parking space. I have visited this place twice and I am so in love with the food and the ambience.",2
Worst experience with this hotel. Food taste was very bad. No attention from servers. We even doesn't know that there are rotis and icecream. No one bothered to serve. Only peanuts was good among all the food. But for peanuts 1000 bugs is too much. And most special thing is a tile from wall fell down where a customer missed it in a inch. Plz don't sit at the last.,0
I ordered Red Monster box mini for 95 rupees. 4 pieces of fried chicken were there. The taste was good. There was another box which had chicken makhani with biryani rice. The quantity was very less. It was not enough for one person. And the taste was also not so great.,1
"After so many recommendations we been there yesterday for couple of drinks...the ambience purely reflecting a typical Goan bar I can say it's simply unique place in the city where you can sit and enjoy fresh air along with Lite music , the staff where amazing I should thank specially Mr Dinesh ,Mr Rahul -thanks for the suggestion on food and drinks your recommendations satisfied our pallets and bellys hehehe..... the quality of food and drinks where awesome the service was very prompt thanks to Ashish,Zamir,Lalu and Naveen who looked after our table . Cheers guyz you people are rocking.

Dinesh and Rahul see you yaaa in next week .",2
"Not recommended for sure.. Average quality and highly overpriced. Took eternity to serve chapati, that too cold ones.. Desserts were good as they have menu options.
Overall disappointed.",0
Best place to order pan cakes in town. I have tried the pan cake with maple syrup and I must confess it was really good. The price is also reasonable.,1
Kiran and Shiraz were sooper host..always smiling and on toes...Good recommendation for food based on our taste....so a big thumbs up!!!! Thanks Parijat for accommodating us at the spot we requested for on a weekend...Thanks a lot !!!,2
Bad experience.. Food is fine but their AC is not working and staff says this is out of their control. We were sweating. Didn't expected this from such reputed restaurant.,0
"We dropped at this place on Sunday morning for breakfast. It's a small cafe with quirky posters and phases on the wall which will definitely catch your attention.
Coming to food, we ordered two combos : shawarma + Nutella waffle + citrus mint cooler and best of both worlds. We also tried spiced bell pepper omelette which was really good. Other items were average, nothing great. Quantity of the food was good.

A beautiful dine out place and especially if you are on a date. The live music was a soulful experience. Even without it, it had the right playlist. The ambience is sure to set the mood for a musical, romantic evening. The music is light, If you‚Äôre interested in a good conversation. The Mutton Roghan boti kebab was delectable. The meat perfectly cooked and aromatic gravy. The goan prawn curry was a delight too. Mocktails were beautifully blended with flavour. The place has a kids play area too with those with children. Overall a perfect combination of a family place and yet a date night location. I would definitely go back there for another amazing experience!",2
"I think there is no point of taking a buffet here. I took a buffet for the purpose of having mutton curry; but it was spoilt. Hence, there was no benefit from paying 2000 for 2 people.

I took this plate like this. I left this plate like this.",0
"I ordered French toast but didnt taste like french toast.Chef team can work on this for a better output. There are very few places where french toast is available, if the taste is improved this place can lead.",1
"Good breezy sitting, great food, friendly staff... the place is a must try for all seafood lovers. The goa themed restaurant makes you miss goa the minute u enter the gate with a Goa 0kms milestone

Must try: cafreal chicken for starters, southern chicken.

Phata poster nikla hero: noodles and blueberry cooler

Parking: ample

Music: not too loud but entertaining and lively

Service: Super quick

Seating: Ample and comfortable

Served by: Mr. ashish

Dessert: try the goan delicacy bibinca (layered cake)



Visiting again: Definitely yes

Thanks Mr. Prajit and team!!",2

Jonathan kitchen had been on my check list for quite some time.. I was very happy when we finally went over a weekend for the buffet..

The early impressions were not great as it seemed very crowded and the ambiance wasnt bright which aroused a non positive vibe.. As we dint want to Go to another restaurant at that time.. We proceeded to have the buffet..

Except for the desserts section which was huge, I was disappointed with the overall quality of the food.. The taste want great and at the same time, the meat had a lot of bones.. service was bad.. There was always a shortage of plates and the dessert spoon they gave me was the highlight of the whole experience.. ü§£",0
"It's a small funky place, with funky chairs and tables. It's a lot bigger than it seems from outside. A low key place with less people traffic. Food is average. It's self service there. So overall it's an okay place.",1
"Nice ambience and live band we have been visited with our family delicious food and nice cocktails had enjoyment time with nice sea food Verites we like fish starter with spices and Indian main course the service was nice by ashish, Komal and zamir..the cocktails taste good and boozy. We all are happily enjoyed with our family.",2
Ordered Achari Paneer Tikka through Dwight and for a restaurant that claims to be a top notch restaurant and charges exorbitant rates for the same....they sent stale stinky paneer tikka which had to be thrown in the dustbin. Extremely disappointed. Money lost and no replacement provided from the restaurant....not worth it!,0
ice cream low in waffle treat,1
"I had a serendipitous encounter with this place on a friday night, while we were driving along the Financial District road to enjoy the cool breeze post a day with shitload of work. As we entered the place, I was just mesmerized by the #beachvibes that it was radiating. The place was already full by 9p.m., but we couldn't resist taking a walk and absorbing the mood. Thereafter, we decided to wait for 15 mins as we are already head over heels by then. The food and drinks were commensurate to the hype and totally satiated our buds. I would definitely recommend this place if you want to get reminiscent of one of you Goa trips.",2
"Came to get dinner, made a reservation in advance. Sat for the first 10 mins waiting for someone to get a menu and water.. after 20 mins of waiting for water and asking a few times for someone to take the order we decided to leave when no one came. Still no questions asked on why we're leaving. I guess one can plan a visit if they have a lot of time in their hands and or are not hungry. Had heard good things but this experience changes my mind completely. Won't recommend it for the service",0
"Late night delivery scenes sorted!
They have a decent size menu for all kinds of late night hunger. Had called for anda Maggi and a chicken sandwich!
Packaging can get better but value for he moment in place, I am not complaining much!",1
I went to this place with 7 friends. The ambience is really nice. The staff are polite n friendly. We had good time here. Food is really nice .,2
Did not enjoy our evening at all. Just realised not to order Sushi if it's not an authentic Japanese restaurant. Nigiri and uramaki were rice and rice and rice.. I made it a little interesting by adding as much wasabi as my brain could take. Waiters were very transactional. Told them it's my daughter's birthday and asked for a cake. They had a blueberry cheesecake in dessert and said that's all they can offer. We'll ordered the cake and had her cut it. None of them bothered to wish her or atleast be by our side while she was cutting the cake. Why do I bring this up? Cos this is a 3-4 star hotel and the staff is expected to be well trained and courteous. Service was very slow.. overall a lousy experience.,0
"Been to this place for breakfast . Choose pancake/waffle breakfast combo.
It was good in taste , little disappointed with the waffle though they were soggy, but pancakes were really good. Hash browns were nice.
All in all I can say pocket friendly place with decent food.",1
"Surprisingly well versed ambience. The place is massive with a get-away-from-city feel. They serve wonderfully cooked seafoods(Goan focused). A tad bit of coastal flavoured along with choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages. I would recommend, to book table before hand; there are variety of sit outs to choose from. I would highly recommend this place if you‚Äôre a seafood lover.",2
"Very bad service, food was not good. They took lot of time for clearing the plates, arranging tables.  Had to pay the money without bill. not worth at all for that price.",0
"Ordered food from this place which has very interesting menu but not so satisfying taste..However,the variety of items which are available seems to be good..",1
"visited with family wonderful ambiemce and live band nice food and service by ranvir ,teja, kiran and mukul friendly and smily thank you guys we will vist again sure .",2
One of the worst places to visit ...horrible experience... We waited for 45 min after placing our order and then walked out of the place without eating anything... First they misplaced the order at a time when there was only two other busy tables and then they had the audacity to come with a pizza and offer us and then realize that it was for someone else...,0
"Located in such a place where numerous food courts are available, their menu is a real eye catcher. Pocket friendly with decent quality & quantity.
Talking about the taste, we ordered chicken shawarma combo and rice bowl combo. The taste of shawarma didn‚Äôt reach our expectations but the rice bowl combo was really good! Need to work on the shawarma cuz the taste levels of shawarma is pretty high!
Regarding the service, the waiters were good & humble the service was good but faced an issue with the payment. Their swiping machine wasn‚Äôt working so i had to go for an ATM which irritated me.
Management has to look after these issues. Their ambience is good and clean! Spent some quality time.
Food:3.5
Service :3.0
Re-visit: wanna try their whole menu!",1
"PERFECT FOR DATE NIGHTS!!!

Beautiful place, with great food and amazing cocktails. Especially there Raspberry LIIT's. Great options for both vegetarian and non vegetarians. You can order anything from the menu and I can assure you it will be great. The only set back is the service. Really slow, just place your order in one go.",2
"This place is overrated donno why it's rating and taste doesn't match. We had a team lunch here. Food looked pleasing with vibrant colors but taste was tasteless please carry salt & pepper along. Only dish which our group enjoyed was curd rice & peanut chat.
Taste , rating & cost has no connection among themselves",0
Tea not served,1
Been the place for lunch and I loved the ambiance over there which resembles the same as Goa and the person who loves sea food will be attracted to this place ..,2
I suggest pls pls don‚Äôt visit this place . Such a worst food I never experienced. The worst experience is I found a bug in a blue berry cheese cake and also so many flies . I would rate 0 if i had a chance . No smiling service would again and again suggest don‚Äôt visit this place.,0
Quantity is not upto the mark. Rice or biryani is not even sufficient for 1 person,1
"I love the Ambience! Food is mouthwatering. If you think you don‚Äôt like coastal food, do go here. Trust me food will get you there each time if you crave for sea food. Crowd is nice. A peaceful place to be with friends or family. Do go there.",2
"They said it's one of the best buffets in the city and my experience says otherwise.The service of the place can test your patience in manyways when it's packed.Everything that was there in the buffet was icecold from starters to maincourse.Seriously guys..??!! Huge disappointment this one was.Been here for lunch on holiday,even though i made a reservation before hand it took 30 min for us to get a table.Service, i always let go even if the service is not uptothemark cause it's understandable and afterall they are human.This one was unacceptable.It was a buffet(everything selfservice) only thing they are supposed to do was provide cutlery which they failed even after asking for multiple times.I walked upto the cutlery table to get it myself and they gave me 2 spoons and one plastic spoon for a table of 6.üòÇThe taste of the food in the buffet,total off.Below average spread and taste.Nothing caught my attention to even write about it.The kebabs were all dry,the classic crispy corn was rock hard .The fish curry,i think they accidentally put fish in the salt gravy.Why is it so hyped,i still don't get it.May be i visited this on restaurent's bad day.But it was a bad lunch day for me and my friends.We just know how to have fun in the crisis,good for us,otherwise you can land up in a huge disappointment.",0
The food was cold!! Could have been better if it was hot!,1
Sea food cravings. Close your eyes and reach this place in Hyderabad. A very wide spread variety of sea food. Can't pen it here coz you have to visit here. I have always been here for the love for 2 things. Crabs and only crabs. It is a must try speciality of the restaurant. The Goan preparation made with recheado masala.would rate that as the best as after eating that it will look like you have been feeding on blood as your hands and mouth would look bloodied. Thats the fun of it. Ambience awesome . Staff too good. Feels homely. Love this restaurant more than anything. 5/5 for everything.,2
Pathetic service. Staff is not trained. Served cold food. Food is not great. Service is way too slow. Staff has no knowledge about anything. Will not come again.,0
"I was feeling like having a late night shake in the pleasant weather and therefore I ordered one through this place.

Fruit pebble shake was the one which I ordered using Zomato but I think they delivered me the wrong one.
The shake has the taste of chocolate cookies, so it was definitely not fruit.

Irrespective of that, the taste of the shake was average and I think they can improve their bar.",1
"A must visit for sea food lovers, brings in GOA to HYDERABAD. Would love to see more seating arrangements in the open area. Great food and lovely ambience. A must visit !! Don't miss out on the simple yet amazing fish curry rice.",2
"The place had too many mosquitos.
Food was served cold and was below average
Service was not upto the mark.
Ambience was good.
Not worth it.",0
the quality is coming down!!! the waffles were my fav and now just disappointed,1
"Ambience is really good. Lot of space, laid back ambience, mist sprays - perfect for a lazy Sunday lunch! Coming to food, recommend trying only Goan cuisine. Didn‚Äôt feel the Buffet was special or so but their Ala Carte is real good. Sea Devil is a starter that stands out - prawns wrapped in Beacon, perfectly grilled. Butter Garlic crabs are good too although slightly on the expensive side. Goan chicken curries are well made and taste good with plain steamed rice - Chicken Vindalho if you are looking for spicy or Chicken Xacuti if you want something less hot!",2
worst service I ever experienced. If we order an item no one take responsibility to bring it. They will stay at the corner and chit chat each other. There was a lady I said ur servicing was very worst and smiled in sarcastic way and went off. They will replace items after 20min. We have to wait for that item. Even bowls for sweets they will bring after half an hour that too not more than 5. At last I feed up with the services and had thought to have sweet and I find an Cockroache in the bowl I called the lady and waiter they did not responded. Then I went to kitchen and called a person ranjith he took the bowl and went inside the kitchen and came back and said sorry and offered 5 Ice creams. We were around 30 people. And he saying to come in the evng or next day. I don't know what they think about the customers. Basically it looks like decent and star hotel but the people and the service just like irani cafe. At least in cafe if we order they will get it fast or else inform us if it late. I heard lot about Jonathan kitchen food is absolutely good. But the people their behaviour and neatness was very very bad. Kindly find the attachment. Thank you and I never visit u.,0
I specially mentioned in message to fry that scrambled eggs properly till crispy brown but they gave it as it is. it wasnt cooked properly.,1
"Great ambience, great food! I would recommend the pan seared fish üëå
It's a little outside the city but the rooftop seating makes up for it.",2
"Writing this review for so called much hyped restaurant of Hyderabad- Jonathan's kitchen

Went to celebrate my bday today..It was the worst food buffet I ever had in any above average costly restaurant.They charge so high for this shitty buffet.

1. Ambience- Even a local resaturant also have some areas of decoration in their restaurant but they have it like a messy hall. No theme no decoration
2. Service- No serving of starters, no serving of even water until u ask,no serving of even sauce at your table and waters think themself like heroes here.
3. Food- The worst part of it..Some stale starters of chicken and fish. Veg ones you cant even chew corn items as they might be few days old.One chicken starter only had some taste. Main course is also pretty below average.Pasta is good.Pizza(so called best Hyderabadi pizza) was worse than a 50rs local shop pizza.
Deserts- they put some sweets of local shops as deserts.
Two juices as welcome drinks were Ok.

I gave two stars rating because manager politely listened to all my complaints on food ambience and all and gave a delicous pudding cake to celebrate my bday.Thanks for that.

They themself agreed that their lunch buffets are generally not that great we should try a la carte..Will do that if I will ever try to take this risk againüòú",0
the Restaurant didn't follow the special instructions mentioned,1
"A place with great ambience and good food. Here you pay for the experience. Which is great and rear.
Would love to visit the place again soon.",2
"Worst dining experience I ever had till now.

service staff was extremely rude, so slow that we had to cancel a few items after waiting for 45+ minutes and asking multiple times for it.",0
I had ordered out everytime. The packaging is excellent although the food is okayish. The shawarma is like having roti and malai chicken. The rumali roti is soft and the filling inside is moist. There was not punch of flavour but a monotony on the pallette. Also their waffles are okayish too.,1
Very good at quality guys..even packaging is extraordinary..but chicken curry is not good which came more liquid with less taste.so quality quantity wise thumsup..but have to improve taste.,2
We went here for a friend's birthday. The service is extremely bad. The servers routinely forgot orders and various dishes didn't come and they still charged us for the same. We had to fight to get those off the bill. The food is also bland and nothing to write home about. Extremely disappointed. Not at all recommended.,0
"I had pancakes there, although they were beautiful plated and heart shaped but taste was not that up to the mark. They were bit spongy instead of smooth texture.",1
Thank you so much for the excellent food.it tasted great. Price quality everything good. I ordered via zomato online app. Delivery package was also great.if there was a way if packaging more environment friendly that would be great,2
"Bad experience ,the dishes ordered were cold and all were brought together on table i.e. appetizers and main course. Sushi was very bad in taste , pina colada was just mild cold... Chilli broccoli was served dry without any sauces and post requesting 3-4 times the garlic sauce was served. Overall not worth it even one star and my last ever visit.",0
Place is a bit small and the music is too loud. Ambience is ok. Food is good and they have a very courteous staff. The rates are quite resonable.,1
"Order no - 1127326452

Ordered rajma rice and what I received cold and badly smelly rotten food. Completely disappointed.

And Zomato is not even helpful to resolve it.",2
"Average food not tasty enough and not worth the price of the buffet, better to choose some other option than this until its the only option.",0
Been here with the team .. felt that it‚Äôs a not a place for buffet.. in starters only chicken wings was good .. in main course chicken biryani was good..desserts was ok..,1
"Whenever you get the urge to eat hygienic food with less calories this the place to order from. It offers a wide variety of dishes ranging from Indian, Continental, Oriental and even Caribbean. The food is prepared in a way that it is healthy, but doesn‚Äôt compromise on taste. Also, the dishes are reasonably priced. My only issue is that many dishes go out of stock very quickly.",2
Got food poison after eating quesadilla yesterday(12/2). Had to admit in hospital for a day had to spend 4k INR. Will never recommend this to anyone.,0
"The name is so appealing that when we saw it,we were like, yes let's go.
Because all of us just looovee the movie üòÅ
But also because it's on a busy roadside. Very convenient location.

It was Wednesday and had a ladies night I think. But as you know, gold can't be availed with ladies' night privileges üòî

We got seating very easily. Don't know of that was a good thing or bad, because the place was very empty. Only 2 other tables were seated I think.

Ambience is okay.. music- can be better. Cocktails were good. You can actually tell them to do some tweaks to your drinks as per your likeness and they would do it.
Service- can be better. was slow , when you look there were very less crowd.
Food is very nice. Pocket friendly place.

Hope next time I get to see a good crowd and good music",1
I had ordered the weight watch veg and it was awesome.. Healthy and tasty as well. Food quality was really very good. I had ordered for the second time and this weight watch forced me to write a review.. I couldn't help myself.. Fantastic.. Keep it upp.. U have raised a bar.. Do the good work always :),2
"One of the few times when the reviews and the hypes are absolutely off the mark!

Went for Grill and Chill on Saturday night... Not a fun experience by any stretch of the imagination....

Ambience - it's ok... Nothing spectacular... Chairs weren't very comfortable and unsuitable for a relaxed dining experience...

Service - this is the truly sad part. Really slow service and servers are uninterested. This really hurt the experience and is unacceptable from a star property.

Food - starters were 4 varieties of chicken, 2 varieties of fish and 1 prawns.... The tandoori chicken and chicken tikka was nice... But unfortunately everything was served cold.... You ask for hot starters and you get cold starter's again...

Main course had lamb korma which was the best thing for the evening... Chicken curry was decent... Desserts were ok as well...

Overall, the buffet was extremely unimaginative and below average. Barbecue nation does a much better job!

The best part - they gave tissues instead of regular napkin ... And plastic spoons for dessert!! Pathetic!!!

VFM - Rs. 3000 for 3 people... And you get paper napkins and plastic spoons for dessert... I'm glad they didn't give us paper plates lol

Not going again!",0
"Environment was kinda boxed in ,which was not so appealing  to feeling of being relax ,but food was great ,beer was cold.Cocktails were not so great but then there was a AC in smoking room so yes it can be rated as 3 star",1
"Very delicious millet and chicken dish.
I feel so good ordering and eating from eat.fit bc I can see the nutritional value and no where else I have found this yet! I love that they give a mini free desert too - perfect sweet treat after a meal.",2
"After hearing from friends, we planned to visit this place on a Sunday.
Food - 4/5
Ordered Pasta Alfredo, Primavera Pizza, Butter Naan(bad), Paneer Makhani. All items were good. My family loved them.

Ambience - 2.5/5 - Beautiful soothing lights. Average setup. Cant consider a very peaceful place, bit of noise with chattering and few confused waiters around. Waiting area isnt great with a wooden log to sit.

Service - 1/5 - This is one area that needs improvement, 5 of us were offered a table of 4. Would have managed, but it was too small, and with kids, situation became worse. we were served just once, no one came again to serve or to ask if we needed anything. It's supposed to be waiters waiting tables, but we were the ones waiting :)

Will I take my kids? - 3/5 - its less spicy, kid friendly menu, but there isn't much for kids to enjoy. And no finger bowls :(

Will I take my parents? - 3/5 - Elderly would like the place and menu options. Decent groups around. Options in North Indian, Italian etc are enjoyable for them.

Value for money - 3.5/5

Washrooms - 2/5.

Location - Easy to find, Valet parking available.

Used Zomato Gold here.",0

"Till now ordered chef's special veg thali, oat meal, parantha in super breakfast
Pros
# Calories and macro nutrients info is clear and loud
# ingredients and making is published and the order is as promissed
# taste, quality are great

Now i felt few things can be improved
# Delivery, i felt it is slow and more than half an hour. Also if we order from cure fit app we dont get the valet number as well.
# Plastic package can be avoided and pls think about alternatives
# Price and quantity ratio : I felt the food items are highly priced when compared with the quantity they are providing.
Eg: Oat meal box is really tasty with a mixture of basil seeds, oats, honey, fruits it is charged 90 rs at centers and online it is 140. 
 I strongly feel they can reduce the price of every product at least 20% so that they can get more orders and new customers to",2
"This is a very overhyped and overpriced place.
The wings are small in size and very shrivelled and the sauces are not that great too. The Jalape√±o poppers we undercooked and nachos were very bland. They just have ps4 games and thats the only decent reason to spend any time there.",0
The foods are awesome. Place is very noisy. Even if you cannot here the other person's voice sitting opposite to you. Dance floor is not at all classy.,1
"Great food. No oil, soft rotis, tasty gravy and juicy chicken. It's a little on the expensive side but absolutely the best when they have deals.",2

"Food was great . The ambience was okay.
Crowd not so good.
Music was good.
But there was not much crowd to dance.

"I am a regular customer when it comes to ordering from amul. I ordered ""all chocolate ice cream"" from amul. According to the description there was supposed to be perk and kitkat and hot chocolate fudge in it but there was nothing of it. It was a normal choco chips ice-cream which I could have got for 80Rs instead I paid 180Rs for it. My suggestion just order basic ice-creams from amul don't go for anything else which is costly. And when the delivery boy delivered the ice-cream it was melting. Disappointed by the service of the outlet.",0
"Went out for a team dinner sizing 30. Had non-veg starters and Biryani. Limited desserts options. Food was OK Ok 3/5.

"Ordered chef's veg special thali from this place and it was just awesome, 3 rotis, paneer curry( which had so many paneer) , salad, dal makhani, sweet, everything was equally good and tasty.

Literally after taking a bite my hunger upthrusted and my hands started shivering.. u can image how tasty it was and i wanted to finish that meal asap...!

Service was real quick comprising both Order Acceptence and Delivery.

Plz add cocktail onion with the meal
Portion of dal was less as it wasnt reaching 3/4 of the brim.

Tu sum up this review I would say... Kuddos and you deserve ur brand name !!",2

"La La Land!

Ambiance- 3.5/5
It has a black theme with modern crafty ceilings & is dimly lit but not dark. One of the pleasant ambiance around that area, best for evenings with friends/ colleagues. The seating was not very comfortable. They also have a bar setup and dance floor as well.

Food- 3/5

We were about 15 people opted for buffet. The broccoli and spinach soup was very tasty and had right amount of spiciness. For starters we had crispy veg- perfect, chilli paneer- very spicy, hara bhara kebab - was decent.
For main course, the veg spread was not very interesting and was not appetising.
DESSERTS were the best! The pineapple cake was really delicious and the Phirni was creamy and perfect!
Overall the food was good but can be improved.

Service- 4/5
Very attentive staff who handled 15 people in a very decent and cordial way.

Overall do visit this place for with friends/ colleagues and enjoy the drinks and music!",1

"Eat healthy, eat.fit. Tried their nutty dates pudding and detox smoothie. Both were very good and it is good to have healthy food like these.",2
I had this ice cream tooty-fruity. It was so horrible. There were pieces of something that were tasteless and they put so much nuts and other bullshit that the only thing that was okay the actual ice cream I couldn't have the taste of that too. I literally puked the entire thing after having a severe stomach ache. DO NOT HAVE TOOTY-FRUITY unless it's just a scoop with no add-ons.,0
"Seats and Tables in the center area are crooked. Couches are comfortable but only for big groups. Food/Drinks at par with any other place in the area, nothing special there. Lights are almost perfectly dim. Environment/Ambiance is really nice. They have Ladies, Karaoke, DJ nights too. Service could be a lot better, as in they put the food on the table and leave you be.

Hard to miss the place as its just beside Gachibowli flyover. Enough parking space. The place remains kinda empty on weekdays.

Food: üåüüåüüåü
The place will serve you with a good buffet. A series of starters and main courses and desserts are just awesome here. Just make sure you are not late as the buffet strictly closes at 3:00 pm.

"Food arrived wonderfully packed.  I ordered an omelette for breakfast and in the tray were also some beans, small portions of bread, potato wedges and roasted tomatoes.  A very pleasant eating experience - though the omelette and sides were slightly cold upon arrival.  I might add - for 160 rupees including delivery - the meal was an exceptional value.",2

"We went to this place yesterday night for a colleague's farewell party.
This is situated adjacent to Over the moon hotel in Gachibowli.

We availed Zomato gold and got 2+2 drinks offer.

The staff was not polite and we were dissappointed with their behaviour, there were a couple of instances when they didn't understand our request and were a bit rude in their behaviour.

In starters, Paneer Tikka, Chilli corn salt and pepper and Egg bhurji pao were good in taste and we enjoyed having them.
In main course, we ordered Dal makhani and Paneer lababdar which were upto the expectations.

Nothing can be better than having a dessert to end the evening and we did the same by ordering Gulab jamun.
I must say, it was one of the best gulab jamun's I have had until now.

Wanted to give them 3.5 rating but deducting 0.5 for staff behaviour.",1

"Ordered fruit pop oatmeal bowl before as well and again it's very delicious. I see that this time different type of oats(wheat based) are used and that the amount of oats is lesser compared to amount of fruits or otherwise the fruit content is higher. Like the combination of oats, sabza seeds and milk & the usage of uncommonly used fruits like pear, cranberries besides apple, dates, pomegranate.",2

"Average food quality... Went there for team. Lunch.

They should increase the number of starters in their Buffet Menu. The Pastries and Brownies in the dessert section were Hard.

The main course was good the Paneer Butter Masala was very good in taste also their Veg Pulao is worth trying.

Overall good place to give a try.",1
"Super delicious nutty dates pudding. Simple dish made with wheat, milk, natural sweetener jaggery(gud). It was topped with almonds, dates, kishmish. There was no cashew nuts as specified in menu. Else would've rated 5.
Pomegranate protect was simply amazing. One can feel raw pomegranate, coconut juice. Satisfied with quantity for both items(bought on zomato offer)",2
They are just making people fools.I orderd for belgium chocolate ice cream they gave me normal chocolate with some chocolate syrup on it.owner is too rude as well.I asked him then he said that it will get same taste as belgium chocolate.Better to go to another outlet nearby,0
"This restaurant has its priorities straight. Unlike AB's, Flechazo, and Barbeque Nation- that swing for the fences and end up failing many times- this place has hit a sweet balance between Hospitality and Taste.

Which means you have none of the irritating, fake-friendly, over-eager monkeys from the above-mentioned places, pushing and prodding you to try weird stuff even if you don't want to.

Instead, you get a homely little corner where you can sit quietly and be left alone to mind your business, until you order for something. Very professional, indeed.

The starters are awesome here; they actually set the tone for the things to come. This place features a wide-range of delectable options for vegetarian diners as well, which is a big step up from its competitors. Kebabs are to die for.

Having said that, the main meal was nothing to write home about. They have tried a lot of things, from Mughlai, Intercontinental, to Chinese, but somehow these dishes don't come together on the plate.

But what actually took my heart away, what this joint EXCELS in, hands-down, compared to ANY FREAKING RESTAURANT IN THE CITY is the Desserts department. For someone who loves sweets, it's a psychedelic experience.

The variety and taste will haunt you for days. The desserts are neither too sweet, nor too rich. Just the type that the northern crowd will go berserk about.

I was thoroughly satisfied, and if you leave out the clove-heavy gravy of mutton and the generic dishes of the main menu, then the place is a RockaRolla discovery. Definitely worth one visit, and then the count will just keep on ticking!",1
"Fruit pop oatmeal bowl was amazing. Surprisingly it's not what typical oatmeal bowls are. Oats, soaked sabza seeds and milk in equal proportions filled the bowl topped with pear, apple, pomegranate, dates and mint leaves. Superb taste enough for a person.
All eatfit drinks/juices are amazing and so was Guava glow. Could actually feel raw taste of pineapple and guava with little tangy lemon. The pepper was unidentifiable in juice.",2
"The staff was very ill mannered and have no respect towards customers. 6 of us went there to dine in and ordered plenty. One of our friends brought butter milk from the next store and sat along with us. He could have told politely that outside food was not allowed. But he asked him to get out in a mannerless way. We cancelled the order and walked away.

Management has to take this seriously and take action over such behaviour. Or train their staff properly.

Profits should be inversely proportional to manners and hospitality. Not the other way around.

I wouldn't suggest a visit to this place if you are not ok with this kind of treatment.",0
Veg biryani they serve here is too good and loved it....located very well nearby to IT sector DLF gate 3. Can be more better and improvements can be made as demand is high in this area,1

A wholesome meal for two, it came in a box full of 3 chapatis each, daal, chicken gravy, raita, salad, pickled carrots and besan ladoos which were obviously low on oil and sugar.

If there's one place where you can order and nothing goes wrong, it has to be eat.fit outlets.

I have ordered tofu burji and lacha paratha for breakfast this morning. There was also yummy tomato chutney apart from burji.

If you ever want to indulge and order a meal that is guilt free, tasty and with great packing it has to be this place.

eat.fit provides you a daily dose of health, taste and satisfying meal be it breakfast, lunch or dinner.

I never, ever, ever knew healthy food can be so tasty.

Order now!!!!!",2

"Everybody is talking about Eat Fit these days! I was curious to know what's causing so much buzz? So, I ordered Chef's Special Veg Thali.It contained 3 wheat flour rotis, paneer ki sabzi, daal makhni, salad, pickle, and a healthy dessert!

I really liked the way the daal makhni tasted. It was tough to believe that it did not contain butter.
Paneer ki sabzi also tasted good. The paneer was soft and the curry was flavorful.
3 rotis were good enough to satiate my hunger.

But I would have loved it more if the salad was freshly cut. The cucumber and tomato slices looked limp and had lost all its crunch. Also, i think they can do without the 2 small sticks of carrot.

Overall, if you are trying to lose weight or get back in shape, eat fit is a great choice. You get calorie count, protein/carb/fat count. You can keep a track on your calories and macros and design your workout days/rest days accordingly.

It's great to see that people are so health conscious now. Eat fit has definitely stirred up a health revolution. Hope they keep inspiring us :)",2
Been there with friends. They took 2 hours to get a starter. No lights and he refused to turn on lights. Regret visiting this place .. I will not go there again,0

The food was amazingly delicious. I ordered the food online and the packing and delivery service was quite impressive. they even sent a complimentary cake which was delicious. the best part about this app is you can order delicious food without thinking about health because everything is nutritious.,2
Worst place to be on a Saturday evening. Service was slow and there were hardly 3 tables with close to 30people in the whole of SKYHY. Two people were serving and 5 waiters were busy watching IPL. This was my first visit and for sure the last visit. I would not even give 1 start but had no other options!!!‚Äô,0

"I wanted to make my adjustments in my food habits and was looking for genuine healthy options around Gachibowli. I did my little research and understood that many products which are being sold as healthy are nothing but just great marketing tricks amidst all of this chaos a newly opened food chain by name eat-fit was my saviour. This was the only place which mentioned the calorific value precisely which is very rare in case of freshly prepared food in India. Few reasons why eat-fit is better than other places 

1) They do not use any processed ingredients 
2) They do daily sourcing of veggies & meats ( That's the real secret for the consistent taste) 
3) They use less amount of oil compared to any other joint in the market 
4) NO Maida No Sugar what so ever in any of their dishes 
5) Daily Cooking (They cook a limited number of portions )
and there are various other reasons as well 

The calorie count does help me keep my weight in check and the best part is all the Indian meals are very tasty especially their No cream Dal Makhni, Nilgiri Chicken, Hyderabadi Chicken, Mangalorean Chicken, Kashmiri Chicken, Tawa Subzi, Paneer gravy in Chefs special veg thali to mention a few. Not just lunch and dinner they started catering snacks and breakfast as well making it easy to have healthy food at any point in a day. The healthy desserts, smoothies and snacks like chicken tacos, Wheat Chicken Momos, Chicken Baida Roti are filling. These help me get rid of my crazy hunger pangs in the evening.

The only downside for me is that it's a Zomato Exclusive and Zomato is pathetic in the market when it comes to food delivery. They promise to deliver the food any time between 30- 40 mins to my location but its generally more than an hour. By the time food arrives, it's already cold which I hate personally. This happens mainly because they assign multiple deliveries and the other location would be too far from my location. The algorithm being used by Zomato is highly inefficient as of now and the customer care executives are helpless. Zomato needs to check this and also eat-fit management also should take some actions against Zomato. They have prepared nice and tasty food but due to their dependency on Zomato Exclusivity many customers are disappointed 

Verdict 
Taste 4.5/5
Packaging 4/5
VFM 4.5/5
Overall 4.5/5
Zomato Delivery - 1/5",2

Moreover, they ask to call any member from your group who is already in to verify whether booking is done or not, party is going on or not. If it was my personal party I would have immediately cancelled the booking and have gone somewhere else.",0

"Very overpriced diluted drinks. On complaining the bartender said, it has very high alcohol content, blah blah and we don't know how the cocktails are made. Very arrogant and rude staff. The order took forever to come. Not sure if this is a Saturday night rush issue or a regular thing. 
When our order finally arrived, they got it wrong.
The dance floor was very crowded and some people were pushing us.

The only good part was 2+2 with zomato gold.

In the final bill, they charged us for 6 extra drinks and refused to update bill.
If you are a party of 4-5 people, please avoid this place.",0

Great place to order decent food. Have ordered dinner from them on multiple occasions. The taste is definitely great - especially their exotic chicken dishes. The indian menu is also very satisfying. Have developed a deep liking for their date pudding. It's great comfort food. The food is not oily and doesn't leave you feeling bloated.,2

"Went there for an office party.
The DJ was so bad. He didn't play any requested songs.
He mixed all the songs which didn't set the mood right and ruined all the trippy songs by making them fast and adding beats eg for Manali trance, he made it fast. Totally ruined the mood of the crowd. Didn't play as we requested even though we had bookd the place. Horrible.",0

Pulav was served in nice quantities sufficient for more the one person chicken tender and rice perfect

As a compliment a very nice Mysore paak was offered great taste !!

I've ordered fruit pop oat meal bowl and it was delicious and it contains green apple and basil seeds and pomogranate and banana and also dates .its the most healthiest diet that one could ever have in an affordable price.it tastes delicious and oats taste good .if you're on diet and want to choose a perfect oat meal this is the best one that you've ever asked for .keep it up guys .,2

Good thing about the resturant is it has a decent ambience.Service was generous.",1
"An awsumm place where u can order variety of healthy food .Strongly recommended to try everything on the menu as it is healthy, fresh and hygienic everytime its ordered.

"Food and ambiance are great here, but cost of the food is high with respect to quantity. Service was too slow and can't able to manage things.

We ordered Raju gari kodi pulao, chicken majestic and ulvacharu kodi pulao, names are self explanatory and village names which makes the taste buds high to taste.  

Overall review: Raju gari kodi pulao is spicy and must taste food if you like some liquidity in pulao.",1
"Ordered the paneer-dal combo for 2 people. It comes well packed in a big box. The quantity of the food is great! 3 chapatis for a person, raita, dal makhni, paneer, salad, pickle and super food supplement. We also got a complimentary banana chocolate cake. So in terms of quantity a 5/5. Coming to the taste - The paneer was soft, the curry was well cooked and was tasty. Dal was decent, probably keeping the healthy aspect in mind, wasnt high on spices or oil. The curd was fresh and good in taste as well! Loved the over all parcel!",2

"The name of this food place and the ambiance is amazing. Food is expensive here, meaning high cost and less quantity. The taste is good. It is advice to them to train their servers to get knowledge of all the items on the menu.",1
Quality of food and packing is good.. Quantity is less in the bowl.. My advice would be to increase the quantity of dish as little quantity won't be sufficient for an individual.,2
"Just because a bunch of corporate guys request for retro songs, you shouldn't ignore the rest of the crowd. Please consider it serious! Food is ok.",0

Me and my friends were at this pace for Saturday club night. Dance floor is spacious .Ambience is good .Overall my experience was good though there was delay in our order,0
The place is really nice and gives a very strong telugu vibe. Nice old songs to go with courteous service. We ordered for Chicken fry pulav and sweet corn soup. Sweet corn soup was ok. The pulav was really good but really spicy which was expected. Suggestion would be to order a boneless pulav instead. Also we finished with a veg ulavacharu biryani. The veg option was disappointing. Should stick to non veg pulav/biryani and boneless.,1

"Been to this place with my friends today, Let me start with the good part first, ordered ""Bamboo chicken"" as part of starter which tasted awesome but the quantity is little compared to the price they charge.

As part of main course we ordered ""Rayala vari kodi pulao"" which tasted good but again the quantity is very less compared to the pricing and also the portion of chicken served is little in quantity, next comes the dish which was hyped ""Raju gari kodi pulao"", they took almost 25 mins to get it served on the table, we were waiting on the table after finishing the starters and first part of main course for this dish to be served, we were kind of disappointed as the dish did not taste good.

In short good place but pricing is bit high, value for money 3 out of 5.
Bamboo chicken tasted good but pricing (INR 435) is high for the quantity we get.",1

Ambience was good..went on a busy afternoon..ordered mamsam roast..was okayish..then ordered ulavacharu chicken pulao and pachi mirchi royyala pulao..ulavacharu chicken was good..royyala pulao was nothing special..service can definitely improve..,1
"The biryani here is very delicious, one should must have this biryani if they visit Hyderabad. You will compare all but this tops the chart in satisfaction... üòã",2
Very bad management. They are a cheat. Firstly they denied me the 20% flat discount coupon which i had taken from dine out. Over charged our liquor. Never going back there ever again.,0
"Too much hyped....!!!

Heard a lot about this restaurant, but finally it ended up with a disappointment, mainly the pulav's.
Initially we were offered complementary sweets.Tried Pachi Mirchi Kodi pulav,Oorugallu Veg Pulav,Kotha Kodi & Crunchy curd cutlet.

Pachi Mirchi Pulav - was nice but lacked the expected spiciness,though its a medium varient.
Oorugallu Veg Pupav- Mostly tasted like normal rice but the spice mix was quite authentic, tasted like baby onions coocked with mango pickle.Quite a different experience, never had one like this before.
Kotha Kodi- Just an edited version of Chicken Majestic.
Crunchy curd cutlet - Good but too oily.

Finally ended the meal with a dessert(Junnu), which was good of all the items i had in the restaurant.

Good thing about the restraunt is it had a decent ambience and can accommodate quick a good number.Service was generous but a bit slow.

Overall food taste was just ok, lacked the heat.Can be improved a lot...",1
I have ordered khabooz Normal which is with salad.I liked the portion size very much I have never seen that much portion size in any other shawarma outlet.It was very much for me the taste was also good.Would like to try their other shawarma's.,2
"Firstly the pictures that they have put up makes this place looks brightly light but it is kind of dark and the ambiance is not exactly as portrayed. Not very crowded which makes it spacious enough. Food is okay but the service was pathetic. When asked for spoons, the waiter asked us to use the serving spoon instead. There was a lot of delay in service and mismanagement.",0
"Have been to this place after hearing lot of good reviews, I can rate the food as very delicious,(specially pachimirchi Kodi Pulao) accurately spicy, varied dishes in the menu but I had a very bad day with respect to service.First of all there were hardly 2 waiters who were available and even though it was not crowded they were unable to address the customers and were confused with the menu as once they said bamboo chicken was not available and then when ordered some other starter came back with bamboo chicken secondly after some time those 2 waiters were missing and the whole floor was left without anyone to take care of guests. I hope that this is one of those cases and there wouldn't be other customers facing the same issue given the brand they own.",1
"Was surprised to know that SG runs a Shawarma hub too. All thanks to SG biryani's which made me order Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma from this new venture without even thinking about it. The delivery, packaging, taste and quantity was perfect. Trust me this shawarma was too heavy and yummy. It came without vegetables, and i felt mayonnaise was less and not till the end, it is always best to have little extra mayo!",2
"TLDR : an avg place with  moderately expensive drinks  ( a LIT in pictures at 550  ) A nice club with good ambiance , but they closed the roof top due to less crowd on a SATURDAY night . It was a happening place earlier , which couldn't cope up with new upcoming competition around it . The chicken wings were undercooked . The only good thing about the place was the energetic DJ with crazy numbers & the dance floor . The staff were not friendly because they tried to stop me & another blogger from taking pictures & videos of the place multiple times after even mentioning that we were lifetstyle/food bloggers (maybe they might have had a misconception initially ) .",0
"Nice place...food was good.. we had sambar rice which was yummy, Guti vankaya pulav was avg...we had Gadwal pulav which was decent and other starters was also pretty decent...but some items which are mentioned in the starter menu(like Mirchi bajji) are always not available...management should be looking in to this....",1
Super taste and packing was nice. This is one of my favourite food. And we had with friends everyone gave same rating. we enjoyed a lot. Thanks Zomato,2
"A very bad experience. I went here with my team, but the staff made sure that we had the worst experience. The food was cold, served very late. Drinks were of bad quality. Staff behavior was also very bad.",0
Visited ulavacharu with my son who are both non veg lovers. The food was good but the quantity was very less for the price that was paid. We ordered Raju Gari kodi pulav which costed around 400 and the meat was very less in it.,1
I bought food from them twice. Rumali shawarma and kubbus shawarma. Both were good and tasty. I liked the Libby shawarma more and the Rumali was also good but Libby better. The Rumali was fat shawarma (means the shawarma was mota) the only concern I had was there was a lot of coriander leaves. I should have given instructions. The taste of those leaves were kind of predominant at times. Except that great and the mayo and sauce addition was great and got 2 packets of ketchup as well. Totally; I am happy with the shawarma and cost effective as well.,2
"Everything since I entered the restaurant was a disaster. I received cold food after 45 minutes after I placed the order, that too after multiple complaints. The drinks quality was not good. It happened twice that the staff forgot the order after we placed it. They had to be reminded about the order. Overall very bad experience regarding food quality, drinks quality and service. Would not recommend to visit.",0
"First of all..excellent ambience. Perfect for family gatherings . Coming to food we ordered bamboo chicken , raju gari kodi pulav , korameenu vepudu , kodi vepudu pulav and my favorite junnu which were okay in taste but the starters were delicious.",1
Shawarama from this place is like heaven . No doubt we enjoy every bite from it . Try dry fruit chicken shawarama for sure . Thanks Zomato and Shah house for such mouthwatering dishes,2
everything about this place sound good .. with great ambiance and decent food and drink options .. I would recommend this place only if you are going as a couple or girls .. they have a huge gender discrimination for guys as they need to pay higher cover charges on weekends than the bill they would sum up .. world and tikki shack will be a better place if they stop discriminations and spread equality,0
"I have been here twice and the food was yummy yummy I say.
Ambiance was kind of historic type with all wooden sculpture kind. It was nice .
We have tried pandumirchisticks which is my fav till date.
Coming to ragi sankati , it has disappointed me a bit. I expected it to be more tasty but it was not bad.
Over all you can enjoy there with yummy food.",1
Delicious and timely delivery! Dont miss the roomali shawarmas! Im on a business trip to hyderabad and this shawarma kept me company while I worked into the night.,2
"This isn't a good place for food as there are no good options. Also, the staff doesn't feel like working when the customers are around. They need to improve.",0
"Location wise it is placed in a prime location, centre of IT area, Gachibowli. Food was so delicious, only if you like Chinese flavor, else don't visit. Interior ambience was not so cool, very ordinary. Different kind of soups and dimsums are available at reasonable prices.
Great place to hangout, but if you are planning to visit in weekend then prebooking is recommended.",1
"If you want Mouthwatering bites then this for you guys. Hyderabad's one of the best Shawarma.

Recommended- spl rumali malai chicken shawarma

Likes-
Packed with protein.
Balanced spices.
Creamy texture.

Dislikes-
Waiting time.
No dine-in place.",2
"Ambience and location is nice. But nice to hangouts only in group and a girl is mandatory to be in group. Else entry will be denied. Thumbs down for stag. Starters are good but main course is really horrible. Very small portion of drinks specially when they see you are busy in chatting or talking. The staff is polite but you have to chase them multiple times for taking orders. You can have opt for this only when all other nearby places are full. The complete street is full of restaurants and can be given priority.
You might see lot of positive feedbacks but most of them are done just to get a free ice cream. Yes, they offer free ice cream if you write good reviews for them. Luckily I don't like vanilla flavour so will write what I felt.",0
"Its a casual place for good chinese food. The ambience is a bit dull, but the food is okay. Service is ok. Have been here on multiple occasions and have liked the food they serve.",1
"As in the name, the shawarma is truly special. And it's more than the money it costs. Tastes heaven. Delivery is quick as well.
So it's the right thing to order if you want some tasty chicken to kill your hunger",2
"The only thing I liked about this place is there ambience, it was good other than that everything was just average or below average.
The service at this place is pathetic , we had to call the waiters several time for one small thing also .
It was a pub with no dance floor, people had to manage with whatever place they were getting
The place is known for its beach view but as we went on weekday could not see that
Food- ofcourse no one should expect anything with the food we get in pubs , it was not good here as well
Overall it was not a very good experience at this place",0
It's a duo restaurant where you can have Chinese and sizzlers together available at one place .... well quantity is much less compared to price and taste is not that good though as Chinese should be at that price...,1
I tried 5 highest rating Shawarma places in Hyderabad and this is the best + most filling place. Simply amazing. The special rumali is the best.,2
"Rude very rude service ..Guys here are very arrogant and worst service ever we had.
Will never ever visit again.
Had starters and cocktails, waiters are not even ready to tell the menu properly.",0
Small little Chinese joint. Good courteous staff and tasty food. Low on your pocket as well. Located in Gachibowli. Used Zomato gold which was absolutely value for money here,1
"The Dry Fruit Shawarma is awesome and every time I've ordered two for my self and I've finished as well, The only hotel I love in entire Hyderabad is Shah Ghouse.",2
Very poor service I went in day time and took 40 min to serve nachos. Food taste very poor. I could rate this place -ve. They have speciality to server hot beer. There staff is not entertaining.,0
"Ambiance-
Shanghai Chef has one of it's outlet in Gachibowli. Shanghai Chef is Chinese Theme Restaurant specialised in their Chinese dishes. It has indoor sitting available with beautiful lights and music in the background. Sitting arrangement includes couch and chairs.
Food-
We placed an order for Sesame Chilli Chicken as it was mentioned as Must Try starter in the menu. Sesame Chilli contained a large amount of chilli chicken topped with sesame seeds and served with Salad, which tasted somewhat sweet. Sesame Chilli Chicken cost approximately INR 280. We also placed an order for Khao Phad Kruptao in rice item, which included fried rice topped with Spicy gravy contained spinach and capsicum cost approximately INR 290. Shanghai Chef 2 offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very polite.",1
"One of the best places where one can visit to taste Shawarmas and can get easily addicted. Just in love with your Chicken Malai Special, hands down. üíØ",2
"Hi . Though I love the place . The service offered was pathetic to say the least.. the restaurant didn't offer the Gold privilege saying they don't offer it on weekends . Later during exit when I checked with the manager, he said there is no such thing .. but we were already billed til then . Our serving staff also asked us to pay via Google pay without bill. So please beware of these things when you are you are at the restaurant.",0
"Decent ambience, not the perfect place if you're looking for authentic oriental cuisine. American chopsuey was reasonably good and the non veg platter was value for money, well quantity atleast.",1
"Best shawarma near gachibowli... Affordable and worth every penny. Delivery valet was also very customer friendly
Really enjoyed every biteüòãüòãüòã",2
Pathetic and rude staff. Slowest service. They had tables free at terrace and at lower floor but still they say that its full. So that there upper floor gets full first which is not good. Will never visit again.,0
"Thier platters might sound a bit confusing since they are more like normal starters but definitely taste good.
A must try item on their menu is bamboo rice. It has tiny bamboo shoots with lemon grass and fresh flavours. I absolutely loved it.
Do not try the 8 treasure hot pot which is listed as a must try on their menu. I did not find anything very special in it. Its curry was just the same as that of paneer chilli and I was expecting a little moderations there.",1
I must say i did not expect much after trying a few so called famous shwarma shops in Hyderabad. But I think this one equalled if not bettered istah shawarma house. The chicken pieces were cooked amazingly well. Loved the cream. Packaging could have been better.,2
"Visited on 17th April Another restaurant which slips on 7% Service charge in the bill. This is over and above GST. Be careful check your bill before paying.

Irony service was really bad.",0
"Nothing could be better than having restaurant owner recieving you at entrance and assuring you of best service.
The restuarant is located on first floor ,having sufficiently spacious area with decent interiors -appropriately giving a glimpse of typical Chinese restaurant .Not to mention the love of colour red and yellow which found prominence here too ! I hereby got convinced to rate ambience and decor (4/5)

The crew was humble and the owner seemed delighted to have us .After exchanging a few words ,he suggested us the best and quick food we could grab .
Owner and staff courtesy (5/5)

We first ordered talumein soup(3.5/5)-moderately spicy and filled with veggies ,which is certainly a healthy start

We ordered mee gorang noodles (3.5/5) - comprised of lots of green and red chillies .a perfect form of noodles to relish .
Recommended to those who are tired of shewzwan noodles

Noodles accompanied with 8 hot pot garlic gravy(3/5) which Went with noodles so well except the excessive quantity of French beans that hindered the potential of dish.",1
excellent to taste,2
"We visited the place on Thursday night after calling up to do the booking for 3 stag entry. We got the response over the phone that we can just walk in at 7pm. As soon as I entered the first response from a person (Nikhil) at the front desk was ""Stag not allowed"". When I showed my phone and explained that I did call to do the booking, he said no. I was allowed after they realized that one of my other friends was already inside the pub and taken the table. It was so frustrating that treating someone so unprofessional and with a rude behavior. If you don't want to allow stag ...say it straight forward or put a notice outside so that no stag would even wish to enter. Don't change your rules according to your convenience. GROW UP !!!!!",0
Food was okay. We ordered two chicken dishes for starters and it had too much sauce in it. Noodles were good. Monis were really good though. Would try again rest was okay. Would try again if no options are available. :/,1
good for late night cravings,2
"We came for just a couple of beers, j√§ger and baileys. Ordered for 8 baileys shots first and they tasted funny for some reason and when we asked for more after clarifying About the taste, they mentioned that it‚Äôs out of stock It so happens that j√§ger, Glenfidditch is out of stock too.

Food was up to the mark.",0
"Ok place. The food was just fine, but since it is reasonably priced, its decent value for money.
Service is ordinary though.
On a sunday afternoon, the place was empty and it was hard to digest. I almost went out but then decided to give it a try anyway.
Bottom line, if i want to eat relatively inexpensive Chinese food, then this might be a choice, else no.",1
Delicious shawarmas I tasted over here. So try here once in life time . Especially I like samoli and khaliooz. Rumali is not so good. Nice nice,2
The staff aren‚Äôt well trained they are non responsive had to wait for them to take the order even though there were only few table occupied and the food is also not worth.. the cutlery aren‚Äôt cleaned they had stains all over and felt like was at a local bar .,0
the quantity of soup was half of what they provide at the restaurant,1
"This place promises to be one of the good Shawarma outlets in Gachibowli. Drive down there for Shawarma is too much of an ask considering the traffic and the parking hassles. So sit back and order online. My order contained 1 Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma and I have regrets over not ordering one more because it left me craving for more. Filled with Hummus and the chicken was just cooked right. It is surely at par with the Shawarma served at Shahi Dastarkhwan, Lakdi Ka Pul. The search for a still better Shawarma continues. My 5 Star rating is still pending for the best Shawarma.",2
"I've been coming to this branch on a weekly basis. Off lately, like from 4 weeks or so, whenever I ask for the beer of my choice(KF Ultra or KF Draught), you guys just bluntly tell me that it's not available. Once, I've asked Karan directly and he told me that they'd be available only during the weekdays. I've visited this place today i.e. Wednesday and it's the same story, again! I'm forced to order Heineken or Bira. The worst part was when I was about to push off after our hangout, I've seen almost everyone inside drinking towers of Draught beer and when I've asked, they just ignored and didn't even care to respond. Like really? Speaking on everyone's behalf, it could be a budget constraint or someone's personal preference of beer, but not providing equal service to every customer is unprofessional and I'm really disappointed this time. Well, what can I say, Mustang is much better-They offer everything in the menu. I never expected that I'd drop such a review for one of the most happening pubs in HYD, but I really can't help it this time. Work this out asap.",0
"Food was good but please send some forks, tissues and sauce packets from next time...",1
Was a great having one of the best shawarma...Everything was just as perfect as it could have been...and specially try the the one shawarma with that Malai one...that is the yummiest,2
"Staff behavior are very bad. Our bill was 636, they took 836. When we reached home, we got to know. No one was picking the call . Dj was veryyyy bad. I wanted to give zero star",0
Not exactly the best place for value for money and food isn't exactly the best either..meat is chewy and badly cooked...ambience is a good thumbs up however,1
"One of the besstt places to order shawarma. This is a Shah Ghouse Chicken Special Rumali Shawarma. The chicken is so tender and juicy, the spicy shawarma with mayo/malai hits right on your taste buds. The quantity is filling and overwhelming. I love this place and I do recommend this place to all my non veg lover friends. Great quality & quantity of food. Keep it up! ü§ò Wish I could give more than 5 stars!",2
I visited this place 2 days back with my frens hoping to have good time.. even though ambience and music was decent... the service is EXTREMELY POOR... Waiters are rude and behave as if they are doing some favor to u... manager was also not helpful... Its high high time they improve their services if they want their customers to come back to them...,0
very salty,1
Excellent taste no replacement for shahghouse shawarma .Quantity is worth .No delay in delivery with unique taste .Try once and without any doubt you will addict,2
Hi.. Really disappointed with the service and staff was rude and not attentive at all.. Seemed like all waiters were already high and had no clue wats going arnd them... Manager was also not very helpful.. But cant blame him with the dumb team.. u cant do much... Ambience is decent but the service is really really poor...,0
it was a ok ok,1
delivered on time,2
Stag entry not allowed on a Thursday night. Extremely disappointed. It was a birthday of a friend and a group of 9. We said that we will confine ourselves to a secluded corner but were denied.,0
was very salty,1
"Ordered Malai Shawarma, it was very tasty and mainly not spicy, but when ordered for 2nd time it was very spicy!! But overall it's good and one of the best places to taste Shawarma in Hyderabad.",2
They have different menu than mentioned in Zomato. They say menu is different on weekends and weekdays. Else place is ok to visit once. They ask for identity proof for entry.,0
"FoodFor Friends in regards with taste it's too good but if you want to order something you need to be aware of packing.
Packing is not good i ordered sambar idly and they didnt gave me spoon how can a person eat sambar idly with put spoon.
Need to maintain those things other than that food is too good.
I will prefer to visit",1
"This is a restaurant provides a lovely, juicy, tasty, spicy shawarma, 1 for 1 no other dishes required for kuch l lunch or dinner, but a bit spicy that makes you give a pause and sip some juice, i didn't do that though
It's a perfect shawarma..!!",2
"I will not recommend this place at all....I visited this place today with 7 friends
We were escorted by one of the tiki shack staff and asked to sit on a 8 seater table
After 15 mins another staff member came and asked us to move to another smaller table (meant for 5 pol max) when we asked for reason he was super rude and said this is Friday night and we will accommodate 20 ppl like you on this 8 seater table

I was shocked by this behaviour because we booked in advance before going there and i was ashamed in front of my friends that I recommended this place

After 10 mins of requesting him to give proper table We started to leave and no one cared as if they don't even bother ..When I complained to receptionist he finally responded positively and managed to get us a decent seat where I can accommodate my 7 friends

Now after all this drama no one was in mood of party so we left within 1 hr

Many thanks for spoiling our Friday night",0
"Used to be great for tasty breakfast, now almost flat taste, unless have other options no more a must have place.

Service standard - okay
Pricing - okay
Parking - unless peak hours - can find one.",1
"This place serves the best shawarma at the most reasonable cost. Everyone should try shawarma at this place. The shawarma is totally stuffed with chicken,the fattest shawarma i ever had.",2
"Very bad behaviour of the staff, no one took the order for 45 minutes, when we asked the staff they were pointing at each other saying he will take order. When we called the manager he was unnecessarily defending the staff saying they thought that table is for 4 other people must be joining. Sheer waste of time.",0
too oily,1
"Although Shah G is famous for its late night dine in facility, the Shawarma is pretty awesome too. A Shawarma with a single Irani chai in the evening is so Hyderabadi",2
"I could rate below one..where I didn't satisfy on billing part..I didn't know how they are collecting customer money , for me it's very disheartening on bill amount they are taking 7% optional service charges..my bill amount was around 2k means 126..they are removed when I was asked to them..it's not fair ..it's another type of integrity in business .",0
Chutney was not supplied for both the items. Cooking instructions not followed.,1
"One of the best shawarma joints in Hyderabad.
The quantity is enough to satisfy one's craving for shawarma. Chicken is tender and juicy and mayonnaise does its work like a charm with the chicken.Must try Special rumali shawarma.If you are a North Indian and love shawarma then this the place for you. Chicken lollipop is also one of their specialities.",2
"Service was too slow. Waiters took some 20 minutes to realise we wanted to place an order.
Music was excessively loud, and reached a point where the speakers couldn't support the playback without distorting the music.
However the quality of LIIT was brilliant.
I didn't like food either",0
good,1
"Been to this place plenty of times.
Ordered special rumali and khubus.
Falafel is also good
Very busy and
should wait for sometime for the order.
Parking is hectic.

Overall worth a try",2
"I went to the restaurant on friday night and have booked the table in the morning itself. But manager denied and said i am giving you a favour for the table. We had drinks but food was pathetic and one dish was replaced when the bill was paid and we have to leave it. Coming to the bill, these guys have started charging some service charge (which is illegal) which will be forced on customers and they expect the customers to pay service charge in cash .I am reporting this to local authorities as they have started booking other restaurants for these illegal things.",0
kk but not great,1
good service,2
Worst food order Chilly corn and they gave us Pakoda. Bad quality food ever better they suppose need to change the name to Worst food we provide and,0
The Sambar had a stale smell.,1
Just make lil spicy,2
"First they had some kind of rule like below 21yrs old( I really respect that check) so he asked for IDs at the entrance we dint carry that but we had our soft copies so we showed that.However one among 6of us wasn't having the soft copy we tried ensuring that our friend was 30yrs old but he dint believe and after lot many arguments finally we were allowed to enter.... People are aware where below 21 can go or not so too much nagging is not acceptable...Then comes the service which was pathetically very slow and we were not even given plates to eat we were eating from the serveware itself...There were so many waiters to serve but no one actually paid attention or were not interested I think to attend people,there are many small pubs where only handful waiters are present and yet the orders are attended pretty fast.... Next food was okayish...the only good thing was the ambience....the washroom was totally unhygienic and looked like haven't been cleaned up since long...won't recommend anyone to visit and I personally wouldn't visit the place again",0
good but not the best,1
so tasty and jucey and yummy,2
"Customer service is pathetic. The manager,  is the worst manager I have ever met. He doesn‚Äôt know how to treat customers.

Place is a complete ‚Äúno no‚Äù who prefers good customer service.",0
"we have ordered rava dosa ,rava masala and ghee idily. idliy is very tasty and rava dosa is average , found hair in rava dosa :(...this should be taken care while cooking",1
"I ordered a Shah Ghouse Spl Shawarma from this restaurant.
The chicken was quite spicy but the taste is good.
Everyone can try it once.

The delivery was on time.",2
Worst place to hang out. Pathetic customer service. The place is money minded and the waiters there dont care for customers at all. Not a good place to hang out.,0
"ordered a ghee roast masala dosa , got plain ghee roast instead.",1
"Shawarma at Shah ghouse is very tasty...
I love to order it from Shah ghouse only..
Quantity of a shawarma at Shah ghouse makes your stomach happyü§ó...",2
"Pathetic management, this worst experience ..would curse manager  ,found rats walking around ,found food to be Stinking,liquor was smelling like pee,glasses weren't washed properly !!hate to visit back again ,
PS: never visit this shitty place !!",0
"We have ordered veg chilly sticks and golden baby corn.
Veg chilly sticks are good and must try. Golden fry baby corn and veg biryani are worst",1
"Every foodie I met in Hyderabad recommended this Shawarma. I had just started loving the one from Istah's, but I'm up for a new challenge. My friend ordered one and we shared. It was awesome. It was spicy and tasty. Then, I ordered one myself, but I ordered the one with salad. What a slap in the face. I came with cucumbers and almonds (what?). The rumali was rubbery and biting into it was a battle. Nevertheless, I liked the Shawarma. It's not the best, but it's in the high ranks.
Edit 1: Yesterday I went to Shah Ghouse again. I really wanted to try the special Shawarma to provide an unbiased opinion. To be honest, I was blown. It's the best Shawarma I've ever had. The meat is tightly packed inside the rumali and the quantity is so much. I relished every single bite. Take a bow, Shah Ghouse!",2
Worst customer service ever. I hope this place closes for good. They only destroy any good day you think to visit there. I hope this review saves someone.,0
Had been to this place for a lunch. Decent place - had a South Indian thali. Food is okay - but can be a better in terms of taste. Decent ambience & Service. But something is a miss hereü§î,1
if u look at the they make it u wont even try it. but once u try it u wont forget it. its aswum. place is dirty and lack cleanliness and hygiene. but taste is really gud and pocket friendly too,2
Worst behavior of the staff here. They don't even know how to talk to customers. I have been here to have some fun and enjoy my evening but had a bad experience,0
"Visited this afternoon, pleasant ambience, temple like feeling with a bell at the door and a idol at entrance. Ordered North Indian thali, taste was okay, not an extraordinary thali though. Served butter rotis, Jeera rice and white rice,5 curries, dal. Payasam and Kheer. Kheer was the highlight which I want to call out.
Ambience 3/5
Food 3/5
Service 4/5",1
"Shawarma here is the best. It tastes different from every other shawarma joint. The way the chicken taste is just amazing. Don't know about biryani, but if you are looking for an amazing shawarma experience, you must try this.",2
The people here are not at all polite. I will never be here again. I don't suggest this place at all. Had a worst experience today. Waste of time.,0
"Had been here on Pongal to have ""Veg Lunch"" since my uncle and aunt were in hyderabad. My aunt insisted on having laccha paratha there which when arrived was found to be regular butter roti and the staff even insisted on the same funda that it was laccha paratha. This was a turn off for me but otherwise it is good veg restaurant to visit in gachibowli area.
So here goes my rating

Food:3/5
Ambience:4/5
Service:3/5
Budget: 3/5

Hope i will have a good exeperience tge next time i visit Mathura Vilas.

P. S: I was able to use my Zomato gold here on food.",1
"A very popular shop nearby the hotel I was staying in Gachibowli. Just a 5 mins walk and you could find the big Shah Ghouse complex housing the restaurant, pan shop, tea shop and this Shawarma joint. 

Lot of crowd and filled with online orders. Delivery boys lining up to take a parcel of shawarmas. Amidst all this rush, I ordered for a Special Rumali Chicken Shawarma for RS 120. Got it in a jiffy and I haven't had much shawarmas before.
 
This was absolutely delicious and filled with Chicken and more chicken along with all of the mayonnaise, sauces etc. I guess I checked out the reviews here beforehand and I told them to make it less spicy. Don't be deceived by the size of it but can be quite filling.  A somewhat pocket friendly quick filling and tasty snack.",2
Wish to witness the worst customer service? Please do visit this place. You'll be amazed to see that such a famous bar could have such pathetic people. There is this manager who has no idea how to speak to people. If I had the option to give it a negative rating I would!! Not recommended.,0
"This is a simple place to dine out. Casual sitting with apt lighting. There Thali and al- karte both are equally good and but prices are on a little higher side specially breads.

Service is fine. Good for pure vegetarians",1
"Best shawarma place in Hyderabad, quality and taste is too good. Eat to have best shawarma in Hyderabad, go to Shah house. Very rush during night time",2
"The place was good and the ambience felt nice until a few friends and I went out for a smoke and wanted to sit at the lounge just for a smoke, whole the so called ""supervisor"" came along and asked us to leave because the seats were reserved, we were ready to leave but we asked what the issue was and instead of talking politely he just started being rude and asked us to leave the place. When we said we wanted to speak to his supervisor he said he was the owner of the place! The people who work here have no concept of good customer service or politeness.",0
"We had been to the restaurant for lunch and ordered of course the south indian thali. It was served almost as shown in the pictures. 

Ambiance: Small & simple. The background music on Kanhaiyya was very soothing.
Service: Was ok. No major issues.
Food: Food was good, definitely not exceptional but worth trying. The poori, poori's sabzi, pachadi, sweet & curd are very tasty.
Price: Slightly expensive.",1
The best shawarma you can have is here. The quantity and the quantity both are awesome. One shawarma is enough in terms of dinner or lunch. I always prefer to have from this place,2
"One of the most pathetic places when it comes to customer service, bad food , and the attitude of the employees are absolutely annoying especially the owner. He would make you feel as if you he is is doing a favor , you won't want to give them your money",0
"Went here for lunch with family members, ordered South Indian thali which is way more better than chutneys. Ambiance was okay. Service can be improved as we have to ask more than once to refill few items. Overall a good experience.",1
food is good,2
The Owner is absolutly pathetic and has no idea about customer service. Pathetic food and bad customer service make the whole place nothing but a horrible place..,0
Bad service and the attitude of the staff is bad as well. The food was good both in terms of taste and quality had they been good service would have been good experience.,1
Ordered Special Chicken Shawarma Rumali and Special Chicken Shawarma Samoli. The taste is amazing and the quantity is also good and sufficient for one person. The online order facility is only available through Zomato. Giving Minus -1 for oil and the amount of spice as the Shawarma is Oily and Spicy but it's taste awesome. Feedback for this great place would be to make it a little bit less spicy.,2
Definitely will not go again. Had gone with my friends for lunch and the waiters were shabby and drunk at service. We couldn‚Äôt wait to get out of the place.,0
"Ordered malai kofta.. very sweet n has a peculiar after taste.. the butter naan was chewy only the tandoori roti was good, the only think i liked.",1
goid service,2
"This place has quite a ambience to visit for üíØ
But that's all you'll get at this place.
They have just two attendant in total to take your order and service time is very poor, I almost forgot I ordered something.
The taste is not worth the wait and the DJ makes it even more worse by his songs!

"I quite like the sumptuous North Indian and South Indian vegetarian thalis at this place. Served hot. Reasonably priced. Not too fond of ala carte here, though I must add it is still better than a lot of places. The ambience and simple aesthetics of the place make it a great place for Sunday lunch with family.",1
"Waah! kya shawarma man!

Really succulent chicken, sweet, flavourful mayo that goes superbly well with the spicy chicken all wrapped in a soft rumali roti. This is a full-sized dinner-replacement wrap that's bang-on with the flavours. The only shawarma in the twin-cities worth craving for. Do yourself a favour and if you only eat one shawarma in your life, let it be this and thank me later.
P.S. The chicken is on the spicier side though.",2
"On my visit at a pleasant evening to the restaurant I ordered Cosmopolitan drink. While my friends beer came right away, they took almost an hour to get my drink. After that day, I got some infection in my throat which I ignored for few days and it got worse. The doctor at Apollo told me that it‚Äôs a severe bacterial infection and I had to take antibiotic injection twice along with other medication followed by various tests. Although everything about the restaurant was nice but not sure what went wrong with that drink in particular which ended me in a hospital!",0
"Disappointed with their so called special Navaratri thali festival .. they did not have any other option of thali during this time and when asked about north indian or south indian thali, they told that they have only special Navaratri thali.. we decided to order two of them..
Nothing special in this one.. by Navaratri thali you would expect kadhi, khichadi and some good options but this was actually a mix of north and south indian thali (utappam, sambar, payasam, kela sabji, mixture from South and tandoor roti, puri, corn n peas sabji, tikki from north) and small mixed fruits salad, green chutney, sweet chutney, plain curd.. they had just plain steam rice ..

They missed serving us welcome drink of chaas/lassi

Overall, disappointed for the price paid and options received.",1
Shawarma was really good and full of chicken but but but chicken was too much roasted and there was lack of mayonnaise which should be increase to make it feel like juicy...,2
"Well going Step by Step:

Ambience is pretty good 4* for that.
Location is accessible 3* for that.
Service is okay too 3* for that.
Food was okay, not something out of the blue. But yes it was reasonable so 3* for that too.

Overall 1* for poor post order served service. I had asked for leman about 7 times before i reached out to manager for lemons.

Same drill happened twice on same day while being on same table.

Recommended for drinks and ambiance but heyy do not rely in their service.",0
"Fine place! Good food!
Bit overpriced to the quality they serve but that seems ok.
Hospitable staff, atleast hygienic dining area and good food that's the take away.",1
good taste,2
"Horrible service, food is below average. Staff is extremely rude including the manager. Ambience is the only good thing. If i had an option i would have given a negative star rating. This place just spoilt my Friday night mood.",0
"We visited this place many times. Not so crowded.
Good ambience. Their thalis are good and a value for money.
Their ala carte items are not so good in taste and not worth the price(esp platters and other starters).
Their service is very slow and you need to be patient.
I would rate this restaurant 3.5",1
quick delivery,2
It's one of the worst places to be in during the week. The Manager is extremely unfriendly and rude. The music sucks and the food and service is worth abhorrence..,0
"Visited for some Navratri special thali...
Taste was good but can be better.. Can be made more interesting with suprise and authentic .. cuisine's...",1
Awesome... before the time delivery.. satisfied.,2
"Pathetic plac, I would never suggest anyone to go here.
Poor service and the waiters have literally no manners at all.
Overall a very bad experience",0
"Mathura Vilas is renowned for it's specialities but this time we tried to offer Chinese food at the restaurant. We ordered a veg noodles and manchurian with gravy.
The taste came out to be just fine. I wasn't very happy with the manchurian which lacked in veggies.",1
The best shawarma to have when in town! I had a rumali malai chicken shawarma which was just right amount of spicy and well flavoured. Filling for a dinner,2
"Worst service and behaviour is extremely rude and unprofessional by d staffs as well as manager.
Manager is short tempered and unsocial. I ll never suggest for this pub.",0
"We visited this place during a weekend so it was jam-packed and a tad bit noisy!
However, the service was polite and prompt. We ordered Schezwan Noodles and Manchurian using Zomato Gold.
The food was fine overall. Nothing extraordinary. The noodles were a little too spicy.",1
"ordered Khaliooz and samoli shawarma, everytime the quantity used to be good now the meat was very less in quantity and quality doesn't meet standards.",2
"This is worst place in gachibowli, let me tell you wat happened as soon as we came in bar worker suggested to sit near corner its was kind washroom near. When whole bar was empty on Friday night, as I gave full mouth full to bar workers as insulted guests by asking them sit in corner as if we are cheap. I gave him wat he deserves. I sincerely suggest ppl not to go.",0
"Food tastes good..We had hara bara kabaab, aachar paneer tikka in starters..Starters are okk ..Not so great. In main course we had paneer lababdar and veg angara...Veg angara is delicious...Must try dish. .Patiala lassi is not up to the mark....Overall food is okkk....But service ia very bad....Management should concentrate on service as well...",1
Great,2
Very bad... Management is worst than whatever I visited till now. Since I was giving 1 start he started scolding me and threatening me. I am totally disappointed.,0
"Love the food here.. but not today :/
Dahi ke kabab - most Favourite - not today.. small kebab no dahi..
Dhabe di daal - big ginger chuncks
Tandoori roti - not cooked

Service on slower end.. Wish ordered food on swiggy than coming down.. its better when delivered ..

Had food but not enjoyed... Please keep the taste and service top notch.. wish you good luck",1
excellent delivery,2
"Really bad experience.
For the first time I heard we do not provide glasses to serve water.

Even worse, for the first the I heard that we serve quarter plate/dinner plate only once on a table and even if it gets spoiled they won't change.

And worst of all, when you try to talk to manager he is not even interested and asks us to leave the table if we are not liking the experience.

Would not like to recommend any of my friends to visit the place.",0
"I visited this place with my friend. It is there right in the heart of Gachibowli's Indiranagar, vinayak nagar.

Upon entering, you will definitely feel good and like a family restaurant, which it is. The ambience is decent but its furniture are bit off. There are some corner sittings which many may or may not like and then there were chairs where fitting in was a bit tight.

Then comes the interaction with the staff. They are quite friendly and hard working too. They do have a quick serving time but thing is their attire was not up to the mark.

Menu had a wide variety of items and at some decent rates. I really liked the way they split between veg and non-veg food.

We ordered quite a lot of stuff but I really liked the dahi kebab. It was good. But with such good starter I had pinned my hopes on Patiala lassi. But that was an anti climax of sorts. They used essence for the lassi. I hope they start making more authentic lassi with a malai on top. That will surely be a game changer.

Overall... it was a mixed experience and hence 3/5.",1
Nice,2
The place refused to replace quarter plate. The service is pathetic. Food is on table but no spoons or forks. The manager has one answer they are playing by rule book,0
"Food is good but hygiene can be improved a lot. Saw cockroaches moving around the restaurant.
Service takes longer than expected. A little expensive considering the bland ambience and service.",1
excellent,2
"Waste of time and money.
Starters served cold, main course was just on margin, very poor service, i repeate very poor service, too much of time taken by them to arrive at your place.",0
"‚ÄùNai, They don‚Äôt have any punjabi Gal‚Äô

First things first, really not happy with their service. Two different groups of people who came after us were served earlier than us and another worst thing was Washrooms din have water supply and that created a big problem for most of the customers.

So finally we got our order after 20-25 min of wait. The lemon coriander soup was quite normal with dense eggy smell. In starters Amrutsari murg was nice with moderate flavours along with malai. This came with grated cheese on top of it which was the only best part. Methi roti was fresh and good which came with 2 pieces. Unlike plain tandoori tasted too bad, it was the flour which got stale over the time may be. Don‚Äôt know how they served it. So we ordered Boneless Murg, i guess it was Murg Musalam, this tastes really good just like as i needed less spicy, thick gravy and nice pieces of chicken.

Overall one time try stop.",1
"MUST TRY

Placed order from zomato for special rumali shawarma which is for rs:120/- which is totally worth trust me.

It is so delicious, one must try at any cost.

Request for less spicy, usually they make very spicy",2
"I happen to visit Mustang Yesterday with my family and friend and i regret why i chose it at first place.

The service there is pathetic. You order any thing ( even a beer ) it takes them 20-25 min.

Even after repeatedly telling them, looked like they were drunk or deaf. Considering that we ordered main course well in advance but i as expeccted they brought the Veg and Non veg gravy and we waited 20 min for the Roti's to come.

The manager PAVAN, i should say is the root cause of the mismanagement. He had just one answer Sorry, rather then managing the staff and taking to them, he was taking the walk in the park.

One Star that too just of the Ambiance and Roof Top.",0
"not too good.. but OkOk. have better option nearby. need better option for punjabi food...
world seems really small everywhere you get punjabi food
#punjabi #stereotypicalfood #boring",1
excellent service,2
"Overpriced menu. If you find the food appetizing here, you must really have a bad taste. The Thai chicken curry I ordered is just an another name for South Indian chicken curry.",0
"Finally! Found something in hyderabad that tastes like north indian food. Tried the chilli chicken and thankfully it came without curry leaves. Also ordered roomali roti which was quite large in size.

Packaging: 4/5
Taste: 3.5/5
Quantity: 4/5

Will i order again: definitely!",1
good customer service,2
Worst maintenance(PFA) and pathetic service. They literally throw food in your plate. Everyone was so busy. They took 15min to print a bill üòÇüòÇ.,0
Small restaurant. Staff is professional. Food I would say was average .i had ordered naan Dhaba style chicken curry which was OK. Dal Makhani was awesome.i didn't like the gajar Ka halwa it was too dry.,1
Delivery guy delivered the food by speed of light super...,2
"Not worth it at all. Paid 500‚Çπ just to end up eating curd rice for the night .

Went here last night, got a table for 3.
The service was extremely poor and slow .
The waiter.. brought ""warm"" water bottle on a summer day .. first dropped water on us while pouring water into glass .. asked for cold water .. he came back only after 3 reminders.
He was the only one around .. wearing a CSK T shirt.

When the starters started arriving I was shocked
The starters were extremely spicy and contained extreme amounts of garlic. Un bearable.
For a person who has stayed in Hyderabad all my life .. the waiter gives an explanation that this is how Hyderabadi food tastes.

Mushroom wasn't good ..spicy and nothing less.
Fish wasn't cooked
Chicken was toooo spicy
Crispy corn .. basic item.. was oily and under cooked.
Potato Cooked with its skin was again oily and totally bad

Panner didn't arrive at all

Water arrived

Left all food as it is on the plate and went got main course...
Biryani tasted like a spicy pulihora

Settled for curd rice

Icecream- asked for a butterscotch icecream with some ""gems""
Icecream was good but The gems were tasting like synthetic chocolate.. horrible .. had to spit in the plate and leave in a hurry

When I was about to leave the panner starter arrived .. I had a bite .. it was ok

But I had enough already

Everyone around my table were complaining too..
But no use ..
Useless place
Never again",0
Been to this place a couple of times and enjoyed decent food. But my last visit to this place disappointed me a bit. Tried in starters sheela ka shashlik fish in starters. Little more marination could have enhanced the flavour of dish. Butter chicken which was ordered more didn't meet the taste buds. The chicken seems to be not that fresh and tasted more like paneer. The only dish which met our expectation was patiala Lassi. This drags me to this place again n again. Hope such things will be taken in near future.,1
good,2
"I went in team dinner there on 10th may .the worst part is they don‚Äôt have anything in main course except veg/non-veg biryani .
Even for staters also they hv very less choice
They don‚Äôt have grill on the table .
Only the staff behaviour was polite
Apart from this it‚Äôs not a standard restaurant at all .",0
"I regularly order from this place and also personally had visited this place.
This restaurant offers tasty food.
The service at the restaurant can be improved. The steward was not responsive.

I recently ordered veg thali Through delivery it had:
2 roti tandoori
Panner butter masala
Dal makhni
Raita
Rice
The food was good and tasty. In budget as well. The packing contained a plastic cover which was a bit hassle to remove.
Overall i liked it.",1
Good delivery,2
Been there for lunch few of the non-veg starters were under cooked and mexican chicken was salty and place was too loud with music too.overall didnt had pleasant time,0
"i should say the ambience is excellent, we ordered chicken jwalamukhi tikka which was mouth watering and yummy but the butter chicken was a let down, i couldn‚Äôt find cheese in my chilly cheese naan. laccha paratha was ok.
shikanji is a mix of lemon and mint and people who like the combo will like that
Lassi is thick and as Punjabi as u like",1
"Man this place. Hyperlocal is one of the go to places when you have no plans but wanna go to some place to chill, eat and drink.
The food is served in matte black plates which is my favourite part.
We tried almost everything on the menu (perks of zomato gold) and nothing really was a disappointment.
The place looks amazing and has a cost feel. They have a setup on the balcony from where the view is just amazing.",2
"Food is not that much tasty and moreover limited items,limited deserts ,its ok for one time lunch/dinner enjoyed in playing hand football...",0
I set up high expectations for the place with respect to Punjabi food but.. the food was ok-ok the lassi was very nice. The price is reasonable.,1
Best place to be to hangout with your loved ones üëåüôåüèª ambience and taste of food... one no need to comprise on that.. friendly staff.. staff sandip very humble and understands your taste.. worth being there... good value for money,2
Today had a team lunch at 3B's and it was a horrible experience. None of the team members were satisfied. The food did not taste good and the service was also late. Felt it was not worth for the money spend.,0
"Food was good but the service was so slow that we did not enjoy much. The ambience is ok ,gives a dhaba feel. They have good options both veg and non veg. Veg food was tasty as well.",1
"The fisrt time i came here, fell in love with the ambience. The food is good and priced nominally. Sandeep was so helpful in choosing the right choice of food & drinks",2
"First the price is too high and the quantity I'm getting is lower than the expectation . You can see the cup it's so small like its just gave me for only to taste it. And about the taste it's good. I like it. And I also got a small bread with this,like who eats bread with a 'Daleem'.
I would not recommend you to eat but If you just want to have a bite of taste then go ahead. :)",0
"Food was really nice...it was just traditional touch of.punjab...since I am punajabi ,so the taste.. especially rasile rajmah... Management could work on more with ambiance n services amenities. For food 5star",1
"Been here for my college farewell on a tuesday afternoon! Absolutely loved the ambience. In Food , starters were amazing . However, main course and desserts could be better.

"I ordered the biryani with great expectations. The packaging, and the presentation is extremely nice, and the aroma was great. The biryani thigh, was frozen in the middle! It's a prepackaged frozen food reheated at the time of ordering. That is not the expectation, at least in Hyderabad!
The fact that it is not fresh offsets a lot of the positives for me",0
It's a small place so gets crowded easily and noisy easily. Although the interior is interesting don't expect much of an ambiance. Service was prompt and their happy faces was refreshing after a long day. We just tried limited items and they were decent. Good to visit for a quick non-nonsense dinner.,1
"Visited hyperlocal for the sundower party and I must say! One of the best places to party in and around kondapur. The place is huge and divided into 3 sections. Interior has 2 portions and outdoor sort of big open balcony.
If you ask me, can spend my whole day sitting and just admiring the view from the balcony. My favourite place has to be the balcony and water sprinklers will make sure you are comfortable through out the day.
When it comes to food.
First dish was :
Green veg Galouti : Mince of green packed with galouti masala, onion - cashew paste and smoked with clove(laung). The kebabs are so soft, that they just melt in mouth.
 Achari daal croquette : Achar flavoured daal puree rolls, coated with Panko crumbs and deep fried. And the tomato chutney served with it, just enhance the taste.
Moong daal cheese chilla : Minced of moongdaal and tomato salsa. It was decent.
Chole bathure : The chutney was so good. Served with potato curry.
 Galouti's are considered to be most delicious and satisfying appetizers and Mutton Galouti  is just perfect at hyperlocal.
Had few Mocktails but my pick was kiwi based Mocktail. Full marks for the presentations.
Chicken tikka: This can never go Wrong. It was very good.
Chicken taco : Will make it simple. Just loved it.
Heard alot about desserts. Next visit will be desserts. Will keep you posted friends :)
Over all the experience was good. Interior might not be the best looking one, Still looks decent but the balcony I must say. Fell in love with that area.",2
"I never received this order 21812387 today. No one contacted me. I asked Zomato chat rep to have someone contact me regarding this issue. Please call me after 3 PM IST.

"One of the worst biriyanis i ate . Home deliverd thru zomato . Very worse . I wud like to cook my self though tired than ordering in behrouse.one of the worst biryani i ever had. One has to pay for packaging only. Big packaging and less quantity. One should never order from Behroz biryani. Do not go with their briyani picturs shown on website in reality its only rice packed in some big attractive boxesNever try biryani here , However we were shocked to find just one piece of mutton in the Biryani. Not sure how Behrouz expected us to consume the box full of rice with a small piece of mutton. We have decided not to order anymore from this restaurant. worst of a kind and never tasted such filthy biryani in my life , and secondly they are charging bomb price for such filthy biryani ie 379 
No taste and no quality. I wonder where he brought his chef from to prepare biryani , guess from a local slum area to get this biryani made and serving to innocent public of Hyderabad

Note 
increase the quality food then no matter what the price is .",0
Average place with average food and ambience. They claim to be a Punjabi restaurant but not really Punjabi at core. The food is just ok with okayish ambience.,1
Good taste of food and nice ambience.staff are really friendly@sandip.music was really good and atmosphere was energetic.its good place to njoy with friends and family,2
Absolutely not the taste we indians love. We would want food to be spicy and recipes at Behrouz and co. aren't the way we expect. Not the best choice,0
"This is a small Punjabi cuisine restaurant where we went for dinner. 'dahi ke kawab' was awesome. Also the paneer lababdar was delicious. We didn't like the rotis much. The naan was little thicker than it should be, and the lachha paratha was more oily. But overall we liked the food. The service is also good. The waiters were polite and asked for feedback after the dinner. We will definitely visit again to try other dishes.
Update:Went recently on Independence day. The paneery curry was just color and chilli powder. The paneer pieces were also very stiff. The rotis were also very rubbery.",1
Visited this place on Friday first of all I would like to compliment DJ zain sabri for playing whatever song I‚Äôve requested and the food was good the ambiance was perfect for me and my friends we‚Äôll surely come back.,2

Ordered for Zakheedar Paneer and got chicken biriyani with the label of veg. This is not acceptable at all. This is not the first time this is happening with Behrouz,0
Need little improvement for biriyanis. For eg. Salt was less whereas it should be proper and biriyanis should be tasty..the spices should add taste,1

Ordered bone less mini biryani for 160. Taste is good but quantity is very less and might be in hurry they have delivered without raita and gravy. I give 3 star rating for food. Worth-able trying once.,1

"# DJ Hardcore Saturdays
# Electrifying Dance Floor
# No Jaggerbomb üòí

# Specifics
Party mood and show your moves are the real specifics here...a bomb DJ...electrifying dance floor can't miss the disco lights and a fire feat at the bartender's...Of course Cricket is worshipped in India...but a big screen for IPL (with a banger of a tracks' fever in the background) is just awkward.

# Food

#HoneyChilliWings .... # ChillyChicken
The former was nice and hot...sweet cum spicy...and that feel of holding by the bone and gritting the teeth for the meat is just outrageous!
Chilly Chicken was hot n less tastier, had more of a Chinese touch unlike the former that had a barbeque descent

#ItsDrinksTime
No Jaggerbomb! The only thing we were excited about...that one word -> 'NO' showered the dark wine over our hopes...well we quickly resorted to
#JackDaniels

#VegItaliano
When it comes to Italian...I turn the switch to Veg Mode...

#PestoRoastVegetablePizza
The one fancy name that caught my eye and also sounded like a veggie delight....with thin and a mild peri-peri crust ...these did well for appetite!

#AlfredoPenne
Of course, a commoner at restaurants but be specific and clear about this chap...because it ain't mentioned on the menu...and there's a good chance it is mistaken for other pasta types amidst the pomp and musical zest!

#Experience
Incredible in one word....too good a musical fest...plenty of area (be it by the table or at the floor) for comfortably dancing...drinks enhanced the Italian experience...and it is a must visit place when the hangout is with Saturdayish buddies...",2

I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani from one of the outlet of Hitech Bawarchi online. It was a single serve biryani containing a single large chicken piece. Biryani was fully loaded with dum and basmati rice was used. The quantity of biryani was more than sufficient for a single person. Along with biryani, salad, Salan and Raita was served. Biryani was packed in a good plastic container and carried in Hitech Bawarchi carry bag.",1

Only the packing is good but food is not at all good..",0

lovely place decent Ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local Nitish was really amazing overall order super spicy wings chicken tikka pizza really very good thanks Nitish will visit again,2
This is a good joint that doesn't care for customer. They accept order and don't care to deliver and they don't pick the call neither they respect customers.,0
"The biryani here I found very delicious but needs more improvement in taste. All spices were blended and mixed well, but one thing they used a lot of spices that could probably disturb the taste",1
"Review :

Recently we've received an invitation from Hyper Local. It's on the 3rd or Top Floor of SLN Terminus, Gachibowli, just next to Platinum Cinemas. The place is located in a good, open area and has both indoor and outdoor sittings to offer. And if you go there before Sunset, you can enjoy the dawn. The Ambiance is pretty good, with:

Full Bar

Nightlife

Live Music

Private Dining Area Available

Wi-Fi

Live Sports Screening

Indoor Seating

Smoking Area

Buffet

If you are looking for a full hangout with friends or office colleagues, this is the perfect place. Their food is pretty good, with reasonable price. I find the prices are on the lower side, than any other nearby cafes.

They are serving IPL Live Screening with Bucket Bonanza where you can get 4 pints of Beer including a veg/non-veg starter. But you need to remember the Entry is restricted to adults, no kids allowed.

Anyway, yesterday, I went to keep the invitation. It was around 6:15 pm and almost empty as the crowd starts after 8 pm anyday. I asked to serve their specialty, so they advised me to try thier special mocktail and cocktail. First, they served LSD, which is a kickoff cocktail, made with 5 types of liqueur, like Gin, Vodka, Tequila, Rum & Triple Sec. and made with freshly squeezed Orange juice. Triple sec is an orange flavored liqueur, made from the dried peels of bitter & sweet oranges. And with the use of Fresh Orange juice, the cocktail taste was so good and strong as well. I was eagerly waiting for the Mocktail. Thought of trying the non-alcohol drink first, then the cocktail. The mocktail was served along with Chicken Taco.

The mocktail was made with Fresh Kiwi & Mint. The flavor of fresh ingredients were significant, made the drink so refreshing. Usually in bars, they use the syrup but here they use the fresh ingredients which made their drinks really nice.

After that I tried their Chicken Taco. Those Tacos were made for Indians, so you can't get the blunt taste, but the real fusion works here. Those Tacos were stuffed with Indian spiced grilled Chicken and topped with mint raita and served in Malabar Ghee fried Parotas. Taste wise they were so good, but the only thing which bothered me, the Malabar Parota. As the parotas have layers, so it was difficult to hold the entire thing. so, I suggested to use plain Wheat Four/Maida Tortillas, I believe the taste will also go better with the Indian spiced Grilled Chicken. And yes, the Tacos were too filling, I could have only 2 of them.

Now it's time for the Cocktail, which was literally inviting me to taste it. And believe me it was kicking off,so strong, but nice Orange flavored & very refreshing. I could only finish the 3/4th of the entire portion.

The stuff were insisting me to try something else on food. I left it on them, so they suggested me to try their signature dish Chicken Sambousek, what is that? That is Baharat Spiced Chicken Keema cooked & folded in spring roll sheet and then deep fried. Served with 3 types of dip, Mayo, Mint raita & Sweet Tamarind & saffron chutney. I liked to try these Sambousek with sweet Tamarind chutney, it went so well together.

Now you might be wondering what Baharat spice is? As per the Chef, the word baharat actually means ""spices"" in Arabic and not a single spice, but a blend of several spices. In this blend you can find black pepper, coriander, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, cumin, cloves, and cinnamon. So, the chicken keema was cooked with these spices. Though the Sombousek looks pretty similar with Samosa, but the taste was very different. And that's why the 3 different types of dips were served.

I felt the food quality & quantity is quite enough & satisfactory as per price. Definetly overall 4.5 out of 5.

Already written about the ambiance : 5 out of 5

Location is also easy to reach : 4.5 out of 5

Service was a Professional & efficient : 5 out of 5

As per my experience, young people have a great option for a Bar Cum Restaurant which serves both quanlity & quantity of food & dink on reasonable price, with nightlife & live screening & beautiful ambiance.",2
"#Zomato Review program
Ordered veg Shahi subz Dastarkwan which comes with the combination of veg Subz-e-biryani and falafel-e-khees. To my suprise I ordered veg and I got non-veg biryani I dont know was that an upgrade for me ?!

Nothing changed but got an add on ‚Äúthe black box‚Äù which has a chocolate lava cake which was the only thing good. The package was good like before and as expected. Nothing to say about that biryani because I didn‚Äôt taste it. On an assumetion the biryani was with good mutton peices and didnt look that spicy and had almond pieces over. Need to improve alot with the service and also taking the taste into consideration for a hyderabadi.",0
"Been here twice. We have ordered Biryani‚Äôs. There were different varieties of biryanis served here. However, the taste was quite average. Since the name of the restaurant itself contains ‚ÄúBiryani‚Äù that too in City of Hyderabad the expectations were high. Being a lover of Biryani and comparing with other local Biryani Restaurants it missed that magic.
The portion of food served was also less.",1
"Monday blues can go away if the day ends a relaxing note and on top of that when you have GOT being screened then things get better. Yes you heard it right they are screening the latest season of GOT. I had received an invite from this restaurant for review on their summer special menu of cocktails, yes they have a new menu for that to try now. They are ""fancier than you are"". üòéüòâüôÇ

I ordered for üçÖüç∏ Blood Diamond Bloody Mary to start with which was different when they added Dijon Mustard. You can taste the mustard twist and smell the coriander leaves in the cocktail. The bartender brought the ingredients in test tubes, mixed it all up on the table and shook it just before serving. My next cocktail was Thyme of Your Life, well that had quite an interesting presentation with dry ice. Now, this drink actually gives you a kick üôÉüòúü§™ in first sip itself. The üçë üç∏ peach and vanilla flavours makes it refreshing but the thyme gives the twist in the taste. I would definitely recommend this beautifully presented drink. Coming on to the food- after going through the menu for a long time I finally ordered the Indianised version of Pasta- Fusili in Kasuri Methi and Coriander sauce. The name seemed to be different and you get a very light aroma of methi and coriander seeds being infused in the cream sauce. It was full of medium size diced veggies like- Zucchini, bell peppers, broccoli and üçÑ mushroom and sprinkled with very finely chopped coriander served with 2 slices of garlic bread üçû üòã.

It was good experience on my first visit. The staff was courteous, polite and very patient with their guests. Overall I would like to rate it 4/5. You should definitely try this place for hangouts.",2
not received any order from your restaurant,0
"Taste was good. But it took about an hour and half just for the starters to arrive. The Veg Keema biryani had a complete Coconut flavor, which we didn't particularly enjoy.",1
Amazing place and best to chill out with friends.Specially the outdoor ambience we simply loved it as well as the food was also nice and along with the service,2
Worst place for vegetarians. They serve chicken pieces in veg paneer biryani and mark their box with green labels. Irresponsible team hiered spoillers.,0
It is low spicy and good food. Don't expect too much. Having a light dinner this place is good... Food is good.. but I am not recommending to anybody...,1
Food is delicious and great hospitality too by Sandeep. Would recommend others to come over here and taste the delicious dishes.. and friendly staff thanks all of you ....,2
I am very very biryani lover and I tried the Behrouz biryani and it was worst. Taste is too bad üëé. Packing is too good but taste is too bad,0
"Food is good but service is not that good and charged price different from one in menu
Items are worth but not good courtesy and customer is not treated well",1
Nice place to hang out... Food was really good as well as drinks.. Ambience and music was really good..Loved the DJ for friday night.. worth visiting the place.,2
"Packing is good, but we have paid for it..
Salan - over spicey.
Briyani rice is good , over masala and very less pieces of chicken .. not happy",0
"Ambience : Normal proper dinning with lcd TV playing songs or cricket

Food : As the name says wide varieties of biryanis are there | If u are an authentic Hyderabadi dum biryani fan then better try other biryanis items except dum category |Kaju kheema rice biryani goes good

Service : 15min on an avg",1
As here the food was good and they serve all the cusines chinese north and hyderabadi and buffet the chinese dishes were delicious compared to others can go with friends for hangout,2
They have not delivered the order and the number they mentioned to call is not reachable. We waited nearly 2hrs neither order received or zomato sup port cant do anything about the delivery. Finally we have not received the order. But mail has come to provide the review. Be careful while ordering from this restaurant.,0
Got nice food but packing not good. In this restaurant best food item is fry pice biryani is the best birani i never eat before. Please prepare food packaging neat,1
"Went on a Saturday night. It was ladies night. I enjoyed the feel ambience, music and dance floor. I wish there could be a better system for ladies night rather than queuing up across bar counter n shouting to be Heard amongst over enthusiastic young ladies pushing you around.
Feel was just right n Music was bomb.. danced till we drop",2
Worst Biryani I ever had... Kickout these blady Biryani from hyderabad..... Spoiled the taste and stinking smell from the rice.. Lokks like they served last night Biryani.. I have throwed Biryani on,0
"Tasty biryanis, food was yummy but service was very bad, poor ambience, take away is preferable option for tasty food.
Food 4/5
Price reasonable
Ambience 2.5/5
Service 2/5",1
Pizza is good...nice staff...ambiance good but better to visit night time to see the beauty of lights...place is very quiet during day time.,2
"Worst biryani i never tested
ambiance is soo colourful to attract the customer
I m giving 1 rating bcoz if the rating star is less than 0 i definitely give u 0 There is no restaurant bcoz ur face will be smashed after they ate
Bloody biryani",0
good,1
Excellent Drinks and some great starters suggested by the courteous staff.. Superb Ambience... Must visit for all and come long with family to have some good time...,2
I ordered chicken Biryani. It's awful. Its not fresh. It's stored. I had stomach ache after eating it. I also got a gulab jamun and that's very bad too. All the taste is lost. On top of all this the price touches the roof.,0
"Went for a lunch on a weekend. Ordered a biryani, in which I felt the rice to be slightly undercooked. The chicken do pyaza ordered had chicken pieces which were not mixed well with the gravy. Ambience is not same as what is seen in the photos. Staff is courteous but lacks experience in hospitality.
Could be much better!",1
"Nice place for hangout.............. and sevice was too great, n server nitish is treat like as friend.....
And his suggestions is very amazing ..... So plz meet him before service..........",2
I dont like this biryani. Worst biryani. Not having taste. Its doesnt mean that biryani taste is good if they are adding almonds in biryani. It should in good taste from inside. On top of this biryani price is too much.,0
"Been to this place very recently as one of my friend suggested me to try this out.Ambience wise it was decent,didn‚Äôt had much rush or was not that crowded ..nice place ..Food was good ,Had Crispy Corn,Bira and Corona üòâ Chicken Spicy Table which I liked it among all,Laila Biryani which I first heard and had in Pine and Dine and after that I am having that Biryani here..ended up with mockatil Dp special which was blend of Guava and Peach,It was good...Can try this place once",1
Amazing place to chill. Live music and ambience is up to the mark. Food is fine. They should include some options in mocktails and drinks. Overall a good place to hangout with friends.,2
Waste food,0
It average restaurant while preferring to buffet. There will be no much varieties. But ambience wise it looks good. Nothing great here routine buffet system. Has to implement to new kind of varieties.,1
The place is within the SLN mall in gachiwali.we took the inside seating.the ambience is petty coll.we had couple of beer & long island ice tea with chi 65 which is yamiüëç,2
"Heard lot about behrouz biryani. So, I ordered dum ghost biryani. Packaging was impressive & quantity also pretty decent, and about taste my only suggestion is keora water or gulab jal whatever you've used will help to enhance the aroma of the food not the taste. You guys have to work on flavour rather than adding too much aroma.",0
One time go. Non veg food is good but veg food is very bad. We went for project party. Ambience is like any other ordinary restaurant. Overall experience average,1
"Hyper Local is the perfect place for a Saturday night for a party scene. Great ambience, a dance arena with a good dj and a tv screen for those cricket buffs in d group. They have everything for everyone. The fries are a must try with the lavish assortment of drinks served here.",2
i ordered my food and confirmed with restaurant. after 40 mints wait he didnt delivered. then i call them again and they said they are not delivering to my area. what the hell is this if order is done then why they are not delivering to my area. Then i had to go to restaurant to take my food that time. Really disappointed with this restaurant.,0
The ambience is really nice. The food items are a bit costly and I personally felt the portion sizes are less too. The food items are tasty.,1
The experience here was so good. The managing staff were really polite to every single person. the food was wayyy too good and the ambience was beautiful too. Had a lovely experience.,2
"One of the worst biryani's I ever had by paying a price of 300+ (just one plate). They claim they are authentic (may be at their house), but won't come near to real hyd biryani. Please don't waste your money by giving it a try.",0
The food was not up to the mark. The Mexican dish had too much chilli and Mexican rice was like Indian veg fried rice. The Thai dish had strong flavours. Overall did not like the food.,1
A great place to have fun good food variety of choices grand menu caring staff.wonderful ambience the best part I liked about the place in the use of space for marketing and customer handling everything is just superb staff were very polite and friendly,2
"Ordered lazeez murgh biriyani, quantity is good, taste is not good..biriyani is very sweet, mint raita is also not good, they didn't give onion salad also",0
"The food is little expensive but unlocked gold benifits, so felt somewhat reasonable, tried chipotle chicken skewers and chicken bbq pizza , the pizza was great and liked it a lot, the service was very very slow, it took 40 mnts to serve my order",1
Best place to party in town hyderabad Gachibowli SLN Terminus... Great service.. Good food.. Nice ambience.. New place in SLN Terminus.. We had a great time with my friends.... Outside area looks amazing.... Thanks you so much guys team hyper local........ See you soon.........................,2
"poor service, lake of responsibility, very very worst",0
The place is know for its buffay but I tried only the Thai Red curry chicken with plain rice. The food was really nice but the service was a tad slow.,1
We liked the chhole bhature as it was not at all oily. They serve good Italian dishes as well. Pizza crust is baked well. Service can be improved.,2
"I have ordered a biriyani and the restaurant took close to one hour just to prepare the food. And the zomato delivery person took 30 more mins to deliver the food. One of the worst service from zomato. 

When it comes to the food, it was pretty average. I dint feel like i am having a biriyani.",0
"Went with family on Saturday, Nov 3rd. Only one more table was occupied so was worried about the place. We were seated very quickly and food order taken quickly and served within reasonable time. Food was okay not that great taste, the chicken wings were good though. Choice of non veg soups limited to 4 types and only 2 of them were available that time. Chicken quesadillas didn‚Äôt taste like a quesadilla. It was like some chicken pieces wrapped in a roti. There is nothing compelling to visit this place the second time.",1
"Bartenders are very courteous and well behaved. Great place to hangout on Saturday night.
Good crowd and beautiful indoor and outdoor seating is available.
Service is really good.
Starters are good!",2
"Not provided any carry bags, difficult to Cary multiple packs one time. biryani quality not good",0
"3.5 Went here for dinner on Saturday night. Almost empty, only two other tables occupied. So were sceptical, anyways got seated. Inspite of this it took good 15 min anyone could attend us. The reason cited was heavy rush in the partner restaurant above!! Wiered.. however the food was served quickly. We had tomato shorba, veg pizza and crispy veg. All items were good, nothing wow to say about. Availed zomato gold. Overall ok experience, nothing compelling to visit again.",1
"Been here with office colleagues, overall a good place to hangout with a gang. But the sitting arrangements during day time is very tight as people would want to dine inside rather than out in the hot sun.

The food was excellent in taste, The chicken dum biriyani had a very different taste and I loved it.",2
"Ordered Lazeez Bhuna Murgh Biryani (Boneless).really disappointed with the the food ,quality and quantity wise its decent. but taste wise its bad .",0
It's quiet and nice but the food is nothing beyond average. The service staff was very friendly though. Good if you prefer privacy over food.,1
The service captain Roshan was very friendly and helpful to order non veg plater mutton curry and chicken Biryani and drinks very good I am very happy thanks Roshan visit again,2
Very poor servicing. No communication from the restraunt even after 90 minutes of ordering the food. Very disappointed. This is how they treat their customers,0
"Went there in lunch buffet, overall food quality was ok except dessert and welcome drink.
The worst part was the bill provided by them was not having any GST.
And when I checked with them they mentioned that they won‚Äôt provide GST bills.",1
Lovely place with decent ambience the food is really good one of the best service in the city in hyper local roshan was really amazing overall ouder dahi kebab chilly paneer super spicy wings really very good thanks roshan will visit again,2
"ORDER NO: 14001414 :-You did not deliver my food and cancelled it without notifying me.Please refund my money.Worst customer experience.

10th Sep 2018, 5:09 pm was the time of order.I expect my money back atleast",0
"Been to this place after listening a positive review from friend. Had lunch in this place.
Starters are good especially the veg ones.
Main course is ok.
I mostly liked Nizami handi and mutton curry.
Chicken biryani and curd rice are good.

But, desserts are very limited and live counter has only one option. Only one option in mocktail.

Overall ok.",1
Want on Saturday night has a good outdoor seating the service staffs where helpful quick service hot @ fresh food was good fish tikka mutton glooti smoked chicken pizza was excellent overall I have an awesome experience service is very nice thanks Roshan will visit again and again,2
"@delivery, poor customer support. Both me and zomato were unable to contact restaurant. Restaurant didn't update status in app as well. After 3 hours a guy called me that he is out to deliver the food. Which is hours after I requested zomato customer care and cancelled my order. And it happened second time. Earlier they answered but said it will take one and half hour I waited and not delivered. This is my second bad experience... Very sad about it.",0
"The ambience of this place is really good. The food is not upto the mark, especially Italian food. The room kind of setup inside the restaurant is really cool and would be ideal for a team lunch/dinner.",1
This is a quite happening place with good food and perfect ambience order tawa fish fry and chicken tikka and pasta verry good service all so very good thanks Roshan coming agen,2
"I have ordered dum ghost biryani ,the biryani is bad,cold and the rice is dry as it is left rice to air...I felt regretted after ordering this..there is nothing good tell aboutthis... I felt waste of money after ordering this..",0
Nice ambiance. Food is good to average nothing to write home about ?. My only complaint is the portion size which is a tad smaller for the money u r paying. We ordered hariyali tikka which was too soft n yummy. One crispy fried chicken whose actual name I forgot. Overall a nice experience partly due to the courteous staff but food portion is something that can be looked into.,1
Simple and elegant ambience polite staff food was really verry good music also good food menu verry less add more food menu service was verry good thanks Roshan coming agen and agen,2

Comfortable seating .
They really make the best and must try cocktails, they just enjoy serving their new trials with cocktails , served as complimentary for me when they tried it and the immediate minute it‚Äôs worth an order of it !",2

"My second visit to this place. Visited this restaurant once, back in 2016 and was thoroughly disappointed. This visit was better than the last one. Was here for a team lunch with my colleagues, we opted for the buffet.

The ambience of this place is decent. There were some minor issues such as the table we sat on was uneven, there was no salt and pepper on the table, also there were no condiments. Upon requesting, the waiter served us Ketchup and Green chutney. As we sat, the waiters started serving the starters. They included hara bhara kabab, aloo tikki, garlic paneer, tandoori pineapple, crispy corn and Chilly eggs. Tandoori pineapple was a little different and in a good way relief from the barbecued pineapple dish that we often have at other restaurants. Crispy corn, hara bhara kabab and the tikki were also good. The egg dish was average and garlic paneer was below average.

Veg Tom Yum soup was decent. The main course was a bit disappointing. Paneer Butter Masala tasted very bad and the rice dish with the tag name Kashmiri Pulao wasn't actually Kashmiri Pulao. The two other Veg curries tasted average. The desserts consisted only Vanilla ice cream, Gulab Jamun and Moong dal halwa. This was probably the most distasteful Moong dal halwa I've ever eaten.

The service was prompt. But, this place didn't give me any reason to why I should visit again, at least for a buffet. The only way they're different is that they offer complimentary unlimited soft drinks. But I think that is not good enough to keep customers coming back.

I've visited places less than 1Km from this place who charge the same amount and yet have more variety of food. If they can't increase the varieties, they should start serving different/new food compared to others because I'm not visiting again if I can have similar food (and better) somewhere else.

Ambience - 3
Service - 3.5
Taste - 3

"We have ordered Mutton Galouti, Chholey calzone, Pesto roast vegetables pizza and Penne arrabiata (chicken). The detailed review are as follows:
Mutton Galouti: Enriched with spices, made up of succulent meat. Don't try if you don't like spicy food.
Chholey calzone: A treat to the taste buds. Kulcha pockets filled with chholey.
Pesto roast vegetables pizza: A thin crust pizza with adequate amount of toppings.
Penne arrabiata ( chicken added separately ): Nice cheesy pasta loaded with vegetables and chicken.
Nice ambience and satisfactory service.",2

Prefect ambience.tasty food.awesome crowd.Nitish kumar served us very well.A must visit place in hyderabad.had a great time here with friend.everything here was just perfect......,2
I ordered a shawarma and I received a rotten shawarma. I don't understand why people do this. It's food. Not any product. If you want to increase the price. Do it. But how can you serve this type of food to anyone. This is completely rotten and even smells very bad. Would never order from you again.,0
I have ordered few non veg combos from here couple of times. They have good varieties of combo. The taste of the good is average. Value for money.,1
Service is good by Nitish..excellent Ambience and testy food..Worth trying all the Beverage.. timely service and politeness by staff..... worth trying this place especially on Saturday,2
It tasted worst. There were no vegetables in vegetable maggi except cabbage and paid extra for cheese which was stinking. Will not recommend nor order again. Waste of money,0
"In spite of what some other reviewers seem to be feeling, I pretty much liked what they sent. I ordered a steamed rice-chilli chicken combo and it was nice, the chicken was delicious, the rice could be a bit more steamed though. Overall, not too bad.",1
Always have good time at hyperlocal. This time served by Nitish and had good service.very polite and recommends best food based on your choice.. good atmosphere,2
"Really bad food. Filled with chilli.

I you hate someone give it to them. They will surely suffer the next day.

They fucked up Maggie. I don't know what kind of cook they have.

Unprofessional, really bad",0
The food is good here...I am looking forward to order more from here... And the food is at reasonable price so anyone can afford it. They deliver ur order in time.,1
"Priced reasonably like all other cafes nearby.
The food was good. Full marks for presentation.
The service was great.
The ambience was good.

All in all, it's a good place to hangout. I'd rate food 3/5 though.
Ambience 4/5.
Location 4/5.",2
Too dry and very less stuffing,0
too many veggies for a non veg box.,1
"Had a great time dining at hyper local. The Non-veg platter, chicken tikka and Assorted wings,were very tasty all food.. Our server for the day, Nitish Kumar was very prompt and friendly.",2
"I've called for their veg as well as chicken fried Maggie a hundred of times just because it is so delicious and has a different taste from all the other Maggie places around. However, 2 days back when I ordered the food, it tasted the same but it had a peculiar smell which has never been there. I took two bites and just left it, those bites created a havoc for me the entire night. It left me with a very bad stomach pain I've never experienced before. Honestly I didn't even expect that it would create such a mess. People always say, avoid street side food which are close to vehicles and all, but this place never disappointed me except for this particular order. So I guess never risking my stomach again. Going to miss that Maggie so much üò∑",0
"We ordered chilly potato and chicken noodles. Both were disappointing. The chilly potato tasted like raw potatoes being forcefully dipped in tomato sauce.

The noodles were totally tasteless and we had to add spices to make it taste better. Worst of all it had no salt.

Not recommended.",1
I went there two times both for lunch.. first time food was very tasty and service was great but second time there was a little rush which detoriated the quality of food and service both a little bit. But overall nice place and a must visit,2
"I‚Äôm a frequent customer here! Just wanted to share this while I ordered A chicken Maggie today, instead of chicken I received marinated fried maida balls(majority of it) which looked like Chicken!",0
"This place has never disappointed me, a go-to restaurant at any time.When you want to give some standard benchmark for a Egg fried rice or its combo with any starter,this place will be on top of my mind.Only negative is they have options for spicy,curdy and ....which they will consider before cooking.Can improve on this.",1
Nice and friendly place. Food was tasty and delicious. Service was very slow. Not able to manage for a bigger crowd of 15 people. Overall a decent place for food.,2
"I used to really love this place and food!! The problem is with how the zomato deliveryman assigned to deliver my food, didn't deliver my food. My order was paid online and he took my order for himself. He turned off his phone and didn't answer!. Even zomato didn't update me about the follow-up. I never got my food.Just the money was refunded, that's all! But is this what you get when you really need to eat and wait like hell,but get nothing!!This is really frustrating!! I don't know why zomato is ruining it's own reputation!.",0
"The rice is not well steamed and is hard. Did not expect this quality of rice to be delivered, else chicken and the gravy was perfect and the sourness is just perfect.",1
"This place is within the SLN mall in Gachibowli. We took the outdoor seating, the ambience is fantastic. Had couple of bears with fries, chilli paneer, dahi kabab and spring rolls. The chilli paneer was very tasty , kabab a bit sweet for my taste buds. I feel the good options can be increased, overall good experience.",2
I have ordered Double Egg and Double Chicken Maggie. I think this is a single egg with chicken less Meggie.I didn't feel the teast of chicken.Very less egg and chicken quantity they packed.,0
"Ordered Potato combo of noodels .It was good but as earlier the packing is not good. No seal and some food came out of box while I opened.

Cimmincated to zomato paid 20 credits but don't know what was it about.",1
The ambinece is Greet for a weekends night party the outdoor siating the Food is Greet verry fraindly staf thanks Roshan coming agen and agen,2
not warm,0
"ordered chilli paneer with egg fried rice combo, paneer was good, but egg fried rice taste is just okay. Remaining strarters gobi manchurain and baby corn manchurian are average. They should improve in starters..",1
The ambience is great for a weekend night party. The outdoor seating view is super. Staff is friendly and very interesting dishes to choose from. The tacos are the best on the menu. Do try.,2
maggy was disaster,0
not so good. I asked for spicy and Curdy but received a one with regular taste. this this this this this this this this this this this this.,1
"Best place to party
Pro
1.tastey food
2. Pizza especially chicken tikka pizza was best . The crust and the toppings are great.
3. BIRA is available
4. The bartender's bartending skill and dance is awesome
5. Overall Experience was good.
Cons
1. No dance floor
2. The space itself is bit congested .
3. We went for 1+1 buffet offers with gold but it was not there despite the offer being shown in Zomato.",2
gave cheese instead of chicken,0
I like the combos they offer and the quality and quantity of food and the way they send it across. Have ordered multiple times and the combos were never disappointing. This place serves rhe best quick food and ready food. Chinese combos are must try here when you want a quick meal during office hours or on a lazy weekend.,1
So quit place nice food butter chicken momos mutton Shrek Kabab pasta verry fast service verry fraindly staf thanks Roshan coming agen and agen,2
Not good and fresh. I was thinking to have happy meal but disappointed now. Hope to have tasty Maggi. Maggi is sticky and fried Maggi is also not good.,0
"Ordered item: chilli baby corn with double egg noodles
Taste: It's neither too good nor bad...noodles is average and chilli baby corn is not spicy...overall taste is just ok
Quantity:I have ordered large box and its is sufficient for one person
Packing:As you can see in the images....packing is very good...especially the plastic forks i didn't liked to throw them away after usage...
Delivery: Ordered through zomato on sunday and delivery time is around 40 mins.",1
This is a quite happening place with good food and perfect ambience with the added outer seating.Menu options are limited but the taste is very good.You should have a prior reservation in case if you are too many people.It has good music along with a teeny tiny dance floor.,2
"Ordered through Zomato for two dishes maggi's with chicken. There was hardly any chicken at all. Wonder how it's double chicken. Moreover, quality wasn't good either.",0
A little bland for my liking.,1
Lovely place with decent ambience. The food is really good. One of the best service in the city in hyper local Roshan was really amazing. Overall I have an awesome experience. Good team and l will visit again,2
the quantity is very less..,0
just ok ok,1
Undoubtedly the best place to have ice creams nowadays is Cream stone. Near to DLF and many hostels. Polite staff and friendly. Always crowded üòÑ,2
"As this Maggi point located at a demanding place, they least bothered about the food ordered online and send us the poor quality food . Better not to order online and do if you wanna waste your money.",0
avarage taste,1
Always love to swiggy this food. Nutella brownie and ferrero rocher is amazing. Well packaged and well sent. No issues till date except i gain weight. A bit fan.,2
waste they prepared food before Maggi was noo taste waste of money I ordered double egg chicken Maggi but I think they put half egg only too worst,0
"Bakery items in the bread section are tasty. Croissants, bagels etc. Muffins are dense in texture and the icing is overly sweet. Definitely can improve on those. Not recommended for strong coffee seekers. If you want coffee coloured sweet milk beverages, then you can give it a try.",1
"The staff was polite and friendly. The quality has been Upto the mark at creamstone from the beginning.


The taste of the ice cream was also amazing and so was the ambience but it was a little crowded than expected but it was worth the visit.

Keep it up creamstone gachibowli",2
chicken Maggie doesn't have any chicken...it is like veg Maggie...without masala,0
"So I‚Äôve been to this place with a couple of friends for breakfast, so I‚Äôd say that their bakery items are out of the world. Freshly baked and you can see the chefs preparing them through a transparent glass.
Breakfast wasn‚Äôt great, would give it a 2/5
They use their own recipes and sauces.
Also, most importantly it‚Äôs a big hole to your pocket. Very expensive. So watch out",1
"Twisted Mango, Mango famous within summer season. This summer you had Mango or not? Guys you should taste this mango flavor. I am sure mango lover will like this.",2
"It seems like they have sent the Maggie which was prepared 2 hrs back..
Not even hot.
The cheese was added which did not even melt..

Very bad experience through zomato",0
"This place serves frozen food mostly. They just reheat the food and give it you.
Liked the cinnamon roll over there.
We ordered Pasta and it was just fine.
And yeah it is expensive.",1
"I had Death by Chocolate from here. I can‚Äôt find words to describe it. It was so good.

Taste 5/5
Amount 5/5 It will be hard to finish by only one person.

I already had three times by now and having more.

Recommended.",2
waste fellow,0
"Just happened to be here today. Coffees are a try out. Caramel and hazelnut latte are good. Vanilla latte is average.
Coming to starters fish and chips can be tried out. Shepard's pie seems good but is costly. Chicken quiche is not good at all. Don't try.
Desserts are good specially croissants.",1
Just because of a silly reason your customer care executives are talking about rules and ruthlessly saying customer has to bear the costs for uber mistake.,2
"Ordered veg cheese Maggi. Could never expect a simple dish as Maggi to be bland, over-cooked and tasteless. Better to cook at home than order.",0
"Situated at one of the prime locations, √©clat was an average experience. Ambience is good and service was decent (guess they did not have many servers on that day). The dessert we ordered was good but the chicken steak and burger were made of frozen chicken which was extremely chewy. Beverages were decent. Had heard a lot about the place but overall would rate it as just 3.",1
"Staff is very polite and helpful.
Services provided is simply amazing.
Decor is comfortable.
The menu contains variety of flavours and each one of them has unique taste to offer.
Prices are pretty decent.

Do try their Tiramisu Chocolate & Hot Choco Fudge. I wish if they served more quantity in the same price.",2
I didnt say to include cheese but they did here. .I didnt liked it .,0
"Staffs were polite.
Cafe is cute and small. Very cozy and comfy. Good for catching up with friends and date sort of.
A little over price.
Could have better food menu.",1
"Had the best of icreams at #creamstoneüç®. We went there around 2 in the morning. .
They have different flavours to pic from. We had alfanso, fruit exotica and ferrero rocher. Exquisite desserts with unique taste. I loved the alphanso. They chopped these mangos over the yummy icecream.
Highly recommended. üòá",2
A very bad experience ever. The delivery guy kept me waiting for more than an hour and yet no response came from the guy or from the chat support. Dnt ever go for this if u r starving. Not even a 1 star actually.,0
"Went there on a Sunday evening with the intention of having just a coffee and relax - as you do in a cafe. This review is not going to be about the food taste and quality and ambiance (which is good as reviewed by numerous others) but a different thing which bothered me once I started going through the menu - how expensive the place is! I have been to swanky places in 5 star hotels, but they are expensive because they are IN 5 star hotels. This place is at an ordinary location with very ordinary ambiance. Could never figure why my coffee was 300 bucks and the cheese cake slice 400.
Taste - 4 stars
Value For Money - 2 star
Overall - 3 stars",1
Willy Wonka is my favourite. It is so Delicious and so chocolatey. The taste is so good and the choco chips are so crunchy. And the Brownie is so good. Totally it is Fab,2
my food had extra money for cheese and other thing but has not been delivered this is not good,0
"I had visited this place on a week day. We ordered red sauce pasta and lemon drizzle. It was good, but the taste was not extraordinary, i felt this place overly priced. The cafe says that it uses all kind of organic veggies and cheese, but i felt the price they were charging was exhorbant.",1
"This place is heaven for ice cream lovers... Used to visit this place Everytime after having biryani in paradise... ü§™.. Best part abt them is, they prepare orders on stone counter only so u see things live happening...",2
"Worst egg Maggie ever!!!
Egg was burnt; getting foul or burnt smell from Maggie!!! Can't take any risk to order from this place again!!! Very disappointed!",0
"Cafe eclat has lot of variety and their white sauce pasta is delicious. But majority of the food lacks taste, french fries lack seasoning and sandwiches are dry. Moreover, i find the place way expensive for the experience offered. I would recommend to go here for cold coffee or chocolate shake.",1
"It's summer try to grab this delicious Alphonso mango Icecream..I loved itüíØ
I thoroughly enjoyed having this one. This is to all the mango lovers out thereüòã",2
not good,0
"Enjoyed the Mushroom & spinach sandwich, felt that it could have had more flavours to it. Chicken pasta was also ok and the side bread tasted good. Liked their idea of serving water in colourful glass bottles. Location is amazing and ambience is nice being a small cozy place to enjoy quiet meals with your family & friends.",1
I ordered death by chocolate ice cream and as expected the taste was awesome and the best part was the delivery packing it was so nice that ice cream did not melt a bit also. Overall a good experience.,2
I got top ramen instead maggie ... I ordered double egg double chicken fried maggie and i got top ramen and that to not at all fried. A big DISAPPOINTMENT..,0
Its a decent place to have breakfast but i would rather say V.Expensive. We ordered Spanish Omelette which was not value for money. Belgian Waffles were Amazing which made us happy. But i would say an Expensive place to hv breakfast.,1
"The ice cream is really good, the ambiance is cute and the staff is courteous, no complaints as such. I like my ice cream to be a little subtle sweet but would highly recommend this to all the ice cream lovers.",2
"Not recommended.
The food is bad.. very bad, the bread is stale and then icing on the cake is the packaging!
This is the kind of food they send, wrapping up in tissues!!",0
"As I entered I feel in love with the ambience , small but very well maintained place
Service was quick and the food tasted average
But felt overall it is overpriced as the food is offered in less quantity",1
"Do I have to write something about this? Ofcourse, all of us love it. I especially love their Alphonso mango üòã. Really like their nutella brownie as well.",2
taste was too bad... it was Maggie or curry I really doubt... it was a waste of money..,0
I thought this place was extremely overpriced for the taste and portions. Very small portions and not so great taste. Could have been much better! Although the presentation was good.,1
I liked the way they present and the staff were all ladies who prepared the order. Ice cream was too good that I felt better than naturals at that time. I ordered fresh fruits and nuts and it was amazing.,2
Food was not hot,0
"Modified the rating after the second visit since there were no salads and there apple walnut Danish had more raisins than apples :( I was told that everything on their menu is out of season.

The salads here are some of the best I have eaten in Hyderabad. Unassuming place with great food, especially bakery products. Their apple walnut Danish pastry is entirely out of the world!!",1
"Rich taste. Exotic flavours !!

It‚Äôs my favourite place for desserts and birthday cakes

Would definitely recommend everyone to try their ice cream cakes !!",2
"I ordered corn fry magi which came overfried üò¢ and the other order double egg and double chicken magi is also not that good...üò≠.
I never thought I would write such review.",0
"The spread here looked amazing when we walked in and their promise of all FRESH ingredients made us drool. But we were in for huge disappointments.
They have too vast a menu for them to handle. Nothing that we ordered off the display was remotely fresh. In fact the Mocha caramel cake slice and the cream doughnut were sooo hard that they seemed to have been made at least a week ago.
We ordered their self-recommended Peruvian grilled chicken dish and after waiting for 15 mins were shocked to find a plate in front of us with just 2 small chicken drumsticks paired with 3 different salty sauces. The plate had barely 2 bites of chicken, but sauces that could easily accompany a full chicken!! This, at a cost of Rs. 280, was completely unreasonable for me.
The chicken and mushroom soup was good, but the bread accompanying it was again hard and stretchy enough to have been made a whole week ago!!
Coffee was ok, pretty much standard as everywhere else.
All in all, hugely disappointed with the promises of ""FRESH"" and a complete burn on my pocket with unjustified pricing.",1
"Very good concept and unique flavours ! My personal favourite is fruit exotica and tiramisu , would certainly again and again just to have these two flavours.

Eagerly waiting for season special Alphonso ice cream !",2
More spicy cannot eat,0
It's a little expensive place I feel. coffee was normal nothing great about it. But blueberry cheese cake was different and good. If u visit the place then their cheese cake is a must try.,1
"I've had a number of ice creams here, and all the time they're different flavours, but nothing can beat their forever amazing brownie break. Absolutely love it.",2
maggie is cold by the time it reached me..,0
"Went for lunch buffet,little disappointed with the spread, at this cost expect little more options. Taste was okay some of the items were good others were ok ok.

Overall 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Food 3.5/5
Value for money 2/5",1
"When you‚Äôre craving ice cream and a burst of fresh fruit and nutty flavours, Cream stone is my go to. I always order the green apple ice cream with nuts but when I placed an online order that wasn‚Äôt available. So I picked the fruit and nut overload and it was heavenly. The rich texture if the ice cream combined with the fresh nuts is a delight. Cream stone can never go wrong!
Taste: 5/5
Service: 5/5",2
the worst ever,0
My experience was not great on women's day. Too crowded maybe because of the discount and it was totally mismanaged. The desserts were of the same kind and all in pink.... Though the staff was courteous and made us sit in no time.,1
Had their nutella brownie ice cream in a cup. Great tasting. It got delivered with proper packaging and dry ice. Great to the taste. Just wish they were priced bit lower :) Will definitely try their other offerings.,2
The delivery is fast.I think they didnt prepared it freshly...the corn fried maggi is already made and it was dry.It was very very spicy.I could not able to eat it fully.I threw it in the dustbin.doesnt want to give any star at all.the worst zomato order ever.üò§üò°üò°,0
"I went here for a team dinner. We opted got Buffet. There is definitely a great variety on the menu but I did not like the food much. It was just okay. As you would expect delicious and ravishing meals from Sheraton, that was not the case here. Ambience is definitely 10/10. Maybe go for a la carte instead of Buffet. Unfortunately I do not have any pictures.",1
Basically i Hail from kolkata...my in-law gave a treat at this plc...just fell in love with this plc...eagerly waiting for opening their outlet in kolkata....,2
"maggie is completely burnt. taste is worst. i didn like it at all. worst experience ever. will never order in maggie point.

worst maggie ever ate.",0
"Good food. Nice hospitality. Beautiful ambience, but not anything extra ordinary or out of this world. prices are a little higher as per the hotel standards. But overall experience was descent.",1
Its a awsm experience...i just love creamstone's ice cream..very fast delivery nd never delayed me order....i wish it will remain same..ice creams are so tasty and once someone order frm here am damn sure they never think to go to another icecream shop to eat icecream.,2
"Food worst taste and please dont order from here as well as from zomato. I orderd double egg and double chicken maggie, but they kept half egg and the taste is worst worst worst",0
"Went for Christmas Buffet Lunch. We were 4 of us. The staff were very friendly, courteous and cooperative. 5/5 for the service. But the food was very very disappointing. The starters were unmentionable. The chat counter, Palak Chaat was good but kanji Vada was pathetic. In Italian, we asked him to serve us ravioli, which was very hard and the worst we have had. The saving grace was the Indian counter. The curries, Biryani, bread etc. were all good. I think the restaurant should stick to Indian and not venture into other cuisines till they are better prepared to do so.",1
My fav past time and this is mine nd my bestie‚Äôs favourite place to chill out. I do order any tine required and their delivery packaging is even quite good. Best part is it is opened till 1 am,2
I had the worst experience with the food and the service.Food is not great and the service took so long.The place is not totally air-conditioned and the staff is a bit rude to customers.,0
"Sheraton is one of the best hotels in Hyderabad but their restaurant fails to match the expectations.
I have come here twice for the Buffet and the only good thing was some desserts.They have very few options in Vegetarian starters.Pizza is not of the best quality whole pasta is good.
Their desserts looks mind-blowing but only few of them are actually very good.

Ambiance is pretty amazing but it's not the worth the price you pay for the kind of food you get here.",1

"*IF YOU ARE READING THIS, AND SITLL GOING TO THIS PLACE - EITHER YOU WORK THERE OR YOU ARE DU#B*
*I STRONGLY DISCOURAGE FAMILIES WITH KIDS FROM VISITING THIS PLACE*

*WRITING THIS REVIEW WITHIN 10 HOURS OF VISITING THIS PLACE*

Wish I could give a negative rating. This place is ridiculously lazy. No this review is not about food, cost or ambience. This is about people and their mindset.

810pm: four of us including two kids aged kids aged 2 and 7 step in

815pm: another large party and a couple of other families check-in

820pm: menu card was give to us

830pm: someone walked over to take the order but not before taking orders for other two parties (thug life!). We order Veg Biriyani, two rotis and Kadai Paneer

845pm: remind them about the order; said we need a couple of minutes

845pm: other groups already served food

850pm: remind them about the order; informed it will take another couple of minutes. My two year old son already started crying for food; elder daughter clearly getting irritated

855pm: again informed it will take a couple of minutes. i said I will walk out if food doesnt come in 30s.

856pm: our family walks out in front of the staff. Staff doesnt make the slightest attempt to stop us

The last part obviously indicates they havent started the preparation yet. So no loss in letting us leave.

The sheer apathy of staff was quite overwhelming. I can understand being profit centric and your obvious need to serve a bigger party. But with two hungry kids kept waiting for more than 45 min at your place without any food being offered smacks of apathy and insensitivity (after being reminded about it). And in this time and age of digital pervasiveness, beign careless about it is inviting trouble.",0
"Ordered Paneer Masala Curry and Butter Naan through Zomato. Delivery was quick and packaging was perfect.
Paneer masala was little bit spicy and tasted ok, paneer pieces in curry were less though. Butter Naan was soft, liked it.
Had also tried Chicken Biryani from this place, taste was ok. Biryani rice was flavourful but the rice was little undercooked.",1
"Great taste, Nice quality, Affordable prices, Effective varities, plus Zomato on time delivery. I order here almost daily. Only problem with this place is Caution : you will get addicted for sure.",2
Food is really very disappointing. Kheema pulao had many chicken pieces and rice was cooked very bad. Even kheema was not prepared well.awful experience,0
"Pocket friendly, sumptuous and decent quality.

This place is my goto for late night deliveries. Their Kaju Biryani is a personal favorite.

Well flavoured rice with a generous helping of cashews fried in butter, this one is comfort at its best.

Their other options are good too and the helping is perfect for two.",1
If you are an ice-cream lover you might have already been here. Cream stone is one of the best places to get many variety flavoured ice-creams at anytime.,2
"We booked for 40 people for an office party and it was a complete chaos. Some south indian festival was going on in the restaurant, so the expectations were little high but a complete let down. Firstly, they had not planned properly to manage 40 plus people. Some people who arrived first got the privilege of getting welcome drink and I arrived 10 mins late, and simply didn't get it. For starters also, some privileged ones got served with only few of the varieties as per the menu. Our of frustration, people started with main course and in between starters were being served. What a big mess it was. The complete team of 40 was disappointed.",0
boneless chicken looked like chicken manchuria not exactly boneless,1
"I used to crave for the place before I visit, and now it seems the waiting was worthy. In each bite I can feel the delicacy. But we had full stomach when we ordered fruit overloaded and chocolava. But I would suggest for one for two people.",2
"I came here 1 hour back . It took them 15 mins to find a table for me. And then the waiter comes and tells half the menu is not available. Hmm...I have already wasted 25 mins time.. so ordered what was available...

Now I am still waiting for the food...

If you are hungry please don't visit this restaurant",0
"I had ordered thrice from here and each time the Chicken Dum Biryani was mind-blowing! Superb taste and with two pieces of leg pieces most of the times, it's total value for money!! But unfortunately I was going to order it again and see that they have removed that Chicken Dum Biryani from the menu..üòí That's bad! I really wish they put it again so that I can order it again...",1
Awesome ice cream shop. Had waffle nutcracker and lichi lake. Would recommend to all. Taste was good and quite budget friendly. Try out magic pops if you have not tried before.,2
"We have ordered Paneer Manchurian but all pieces of paneer are very hard to bite struggled alot, got irritated that's why we won't prefer this to anyone",0
"not tasty, too sweet",1
"Though busy but an awesome place to hang out. Grab some delicious combinations of chocolate & Nutty ice-creams, shakes, waffles and you could probably have the best ice-creams to satisfy your cravings.",2
"Had been here to taste authentic andhra/telangana Cuisine. 
Tried the Cashew chicken starter and the Prawn biriyani. 

The starter was nothing but boneless chicken fried in some bland batter with fried cashew stuck to it. It looked like some home made beginner dish. It was really dry. The server even forgot to give me chutney with it. 

The only thing andhra about the biriyani was the spice level. It was above normal levels. Otherwise no special flavour. The dish didnt have enough salt , which we added later, OURSELF. 
There was some birthday party going on, because of which each dish took an hour to get to us. 

After all this hassle, they give  us complimentary gulab jamun from the buffet which was nowhere a compensation for the bad experience or for the price we paid. 

I am just hoping this isnt the real telangana cuisine which it is famous for and I was just at the wrong place.",0
Loved the food.,1
"One of my favourite cream stone. Loved the taste with brownie ""Chocovala"". I was completely satisfied with the Chocovala . I will suggest this to my friends, they can also enjoy this same feeling.",2
"*Writing this review as soon as I got out of the restaurant*
From the beginning itself the restaurant caught my bad impression and bad experience. Left right after starters. I wouldn't even care to rate it one star. One of worst restaurants to dine-in. I think it'll be good experience for corporate lunches or dinners because the more the people the more theüí∞üí∞üí∞
After reaching at 2 PM there was no receptionist. After the receptionist finally came they made us wait for more than 20 minutes to find and set up the table for just 2 people. It was very clear that the tables just needed plates to be arranged. That's it. A piece of advise to y'all: if you see any restaurant taking this long without any valid reason then please get outta there. Neither proper AC chambers nor proper cooling. It was HOT. Thanks POT POURRI for understanding and making our dining uncomfortableüòí. After we sat they took extremely long time and then cared to ask if we're opting for veg or non-veg. By this time I was already wondering if they thought we're idiots and they can just make us wait and treat however they want, I just realised that it was true.
After soup and buttermilk starters were served PAINFULLY SLOW. It took MORE THAN AN HOUR FOR THEM TO FINISH SERVING JUST 6 STARTERS. Were they kidding me?? They wasted my precious time and this isn't what a customer wants. If you can't give importance to our time then we better eat elsewhere. We had to school the waiters regarding their service, then we spoke to their leader(I guess) and he also gave the same old typical answer ""sorry. I'll just get that served for you"". We don't want no sorry. You can't placate us with sorry for our time, hard work and money spent. After seeing no improvement we finally had to speak to the manager as listen to ""sorrys"". I decided to leave the restaurant. After all this HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO CHARGE US THE COMPLETE BILL. It was 1100. It wasn't even worth it even if we had the whole menu. After arguing he decided to give 10% discount which in his case made a hole in his pocket as as if it would make it up for the experience we hadüòí. Wouldn't suggest nor would even like to think about this restaurant.
Starters: I found the starters to be normal good in quality. Not very impressive nor was menu standing out. If you pay 100-200 more you'll be getting much better restaurant in many aspects especially in terms of food.
1. Soup: we were served chicken soup. It wasn't impressive. It was fine.
2. Buttermilk under drinks: it was tasty.
3. Chicken tikka: it was ok. It was hard, sometimes soft.
4. Ajwani paneer tikka: it was very good in taste.
5. Kodi vepudu: it was chicken with common known marination. I mean it felt like typical Indian curry. It was just good.
6. Fried veg green chilli: it was just ok in taste. Couldn't make out if it's actually chilly.
7. Corn fried fish: it was fish coated with corn flakes which was giving nice honey taste. Probably this is the only best thing there.
8. Crispy corn: corn was crispy as expected and tasted good.
Main course: I found it to be typically common. Nothing new if you've been to buffets before.
Accompaniments were regular papad, curd, naan, roti.
Desserts: not much varieties. What's there is menu is served.
Ambience: I don't care about ambience as long as food is good and my patience isn't tested.",0
very OILly inspite of saying put less oil but good quantity,1
#Masti time helped a lot ... Refreshing memories #Office time best choice for the ice cream shops nearby Gachibowli ! Do try Death by Chocolate üòãüòã,2
"They took the reservation before 4 days for buffet. But when we reached there, they are saying there is no reservation on that name and we have no buffet today. They wasted our time and response is not at all proper.",0
This tempteys is just near dlf building I drank choco brownie its yum to drink its orea n brownie mixture and its around 189rs.my friend drank mango shake its having essence taste rather than mango taste and it is around 145rs.i expected mangoes but no mangoes are their in that shake and its little disappointing.They write some note on the sticky notes and stick it to the wall.The ambience is good and enough space for parking too.,1
"As we all know that cream stone is a good place for hangout and it's quite famous for best ice cream.

I love this place and I was in my office so we are thinking to order but again we decided to go there and have fun.

So me and my friends was started our trip and it was a fun while reaching there.

We reach there and have some stone ice cream it was a really good concept of making ice cream on stone and it was a perfect way to make because I have seen many place of making stone ice cream but it was totally different and perfect way .

We enjoyed our night at cream stone and it was really good time with my friend at cream stone.",2
Except for service and the starters to some extent nothing was good at this place we tried the buffet and after starters nothing was worth eating and I successfully wasted Rs.649 .I hope they improve it when I visit the next time.,0
"Ordered potato wedges, and I found them very tasty and crispyü§ó served with salsa sauce and mayo, althought I beleive that packaging can be improved a lot.",1
"I am a huge fan of Cream Stone's Death by Chocolate ice cream. I've never personally been there, and I always got it delivered.
The packing is always so amazing. It's one box of chocolate cake with loaded chocolate sauce and another box that has a mix of vanilla and chocolate ice cream.
It's a must try for all the chocolate lovers out there.",2
"Went here for a team lunch party a while back and I swear to God the food was pathetic. The starters they server were cold and even after calling out the waiter multiple times there wasn't a positive response.
When we called the manager, there was a redo of the starter which was hot now but not tasty.
The ambience is good though. If only the food and service were upped then the place could deserve better rating.
All we ate that day was curd rice üòë the entire team.
I wish you guys could improve and we would try here again.",0
Ordered a butterscotch thick shake for home delivery. Good consistency but too sweet to finish the full glass. Will definitely try other shakes.,1
"The best shop worth to buy desserts. I brought a caramel sutra. Its osssssom!!!
From packing, delivering to food taste, everything is fine....
My first order after reaching Hyderabad!!",2
"Worst service provided!!!! The ambience felt like a zombie area. The team over there was very confused for nothing.From the time they started taking the order til the time of the bill the waiters were so unpleasant,so unhappy,so irritating(especially a lady there) OMG that lady started giving rude replies when we asked for service . The manager there was "" Lost ""too. Food wasn't that great, it's not worth that price. Overall experience was horribleüòë#Totally unhappy# Never recommend anyone who opts for a good lunch or dinner",0
"Since i am not an ice cream lover, still i ordered oreo brownie thick shake. The shake was good enough. Need to improve packing while delivery.
Price - 3.5/5
Delivery - 5/5
Taste - 3/5",1
"Visited this place a while back. Their ice creams are totally worth it! I'd suggest try their listed sundaes rather than make a custom one: the pre-listed choices are just so much better. the only issue is their seating space is a little less, so we took our ice creams to go. But would recommend it just for the taste.",2
Service was horrible. Waiters dint even feel like taking the order....(the resturant was not busy also for giving that as an excuse) Resturant has very poor service,0
"Caramel Brownie was the best I could grab here and I strongly recommend the same...

When it comes to snacks they have potato wedges and french fries with multiple flavors...

A decent outlet that can accommodate around 12 visitors.. pretty clean and pleasant ambiance...

The service could ha e been a little better, I always look out for friendlg staffs !",1
"I had Dry Fruit Overload ice cream from this outlet. It was the most amazing experience I had on that day. If I have to order an ice cream again, I will surely choose Cream Stone again. Damn, it was so amazing! I am out of words right now.",2
"Not many varieties available. Taste not that good.
Ambience not good too. Don't understand why people have rated it so high on zomato. Went for team lunch, it was complete waste of money. Everyone was so unhappy that we made this decision.",0
"nice milkshakes but loosing its quality since the inception. i feel artificial flavors dominate shakes. good ambience, nice staff. 

Ambience: 4/5
food:         3/5
Service:     4/5",1
Interior is good but small one and quality of ice cream also good but some of the items like chocolate u can't eat alone bcz of it Sweetness,2
I have been to this place for my team lunch on 22nd Feb. We opted for buffet. Just to serve the soup they took 20 mins and starters for another 15 mins. Apparently they didn‚Äôt serve the soup to all my team members and when we tried talking to the manager he was not available neither the servers. They hardly have any options available for veg or non-veg. Food taste is not great and whole service is pathetic. What we thought will be a memorable time resulted in frustration for choosing this place. Not going again neither recommend.,0
"This was the first time I ordered from Tempteys looking at the reviews and their descriptions of food preparation. I ordered Choco Brownie shake with choco chips as extra toppings, but it was average in taste, not that good what I expected. So for me my first experience was average for the taste of the shake.",1
The more you have the more you crave. One of the best icecream concepts ever. The way they serve icecream blended in the taste itself is just awesome,2
"Food is not good , we all came here for Team lunch in starter we only got 4 item but the taste of the starter is not good. So this place is not good for veg and non veg lover lovers. In sweets we have two ice cream flavours and rasgulla and kaddu ka kheer etc who will eat kaddu ka kheer",0
Usually I order the same shake from this place it used to be so good. Today I felt that the whipped cream being added had very bad smell and taste. Couldn't finish even half of it.,1
I had gone to this place and ordered nutty overload icecream and chocolate icecream with waffles. The nutty overload icecream was really good.,2
Toooooo spicy food upset my stomach also some chicken is uncooked I am sorry to say this but we suffered so I am being honest here there is no intention to harm,0
I ordered veg samosas and egg puffs from this outlet. Samosa for some reason had kabuli chana in it although taste was fine. Egg puffs were stale and not so good in taste.,1
"Ordered Nuts Overloaded. Tasted like nothing you could have ever tasted. With every bite of the ice-cream, you get loads of nut in your mouth.
Cream Stone has variety of self made ice creams which will make you feel special.(Ye Maine kuch bhi likh diya, couldn't think of what to write.)",2
"Slow Service. Food's not upto the mark. This restaurant seems in love with sugar, they put it veggies and soup in bulk. Service staff was not courteous.",0
"KS Bakers stick to the tried and tested spread of options - pastries and quick snacks. They have a wide variety of baked pastries and burgers along with cakes too.

Their space in Gachibowli is quite roomy yet simple. On the whole, a must visit if you want to receive quick service and decent food.",1
"Cream stone is already aware brand chain as we all know and their quality and making of icecream and shakes are super and every one should try once, its costly but the quality also high",2
"Food: Extremely spicy. Noodles were made in Andhra style, were very spicy and had whole red chillies in it. There was hair in chicken.
Service: Bad, takes forever to bring food.",0
"A decent bakery with a ready-made cake delivery option at short notice, which has come to rescue many times.
Their chocolate truffle cake is pretty good.",1
I have ordered willy Wonka for home delivery.. It became over frozen by the time I received the same.. I did a complain and very next day Cream stone sent another ice cream for free.. Keep up ur good service,2
i visited this place last friday with my friends and we had ala carte. I don‚Äôt want to give any rating the service was very poor and slow there main focus was people having buffet. After waiting for 25 mins and lot of reminders we got our food. When the bill came they have added additional items which we didn‚Äôt had cost around 600 to the bill and my friends bad she didn‚Äôt checked the bill that time. So after this horrible experience i will suggest not to visit and id you are visting and having ala carte please cross check the bill before paying otherwise you can be the next victims of this thugs restaurant.,0
"A new place that slowly turned out into a hangout eatery for people with shallow pockets. The lighting & ambience is warm . I love eating the chicken roll that hardly costs 35 bucks . A burger costs only 70. Lot of University students depend on KS for a cheap dinner delivery. You get free chips with everything you order .
But personally I felt the cheese they use is a bit weird & about sweet for the taste of a traditional Pizza hut afficianado.",1
"Cream stone is just an amazing place to have some dessert. They have almost all the flavors that you can ask for in icecreams. They have Shakes, Waffles, ice creams, sundaes and what not.

The ambiance is good and they have a seating arrangement for about 15 peoples.

I tried the Red Velvet and Willy Wonka Icecreams. They are served on a cone which is also very crispy.
Willy Wonka is made from Chocolate, brownies, and nuts and it was amazing and so was the red velvet one. One ice cream is too heavy for a single person so try accordingly.

Must try if you have a sweet tooth!!!",2
"The worst experience that I had along with friends. The starters are good but the main course is completely tasteless. Even after informing the management about the taste, they were asking if salt or spice is more, but not about the overall quality & taste about the food. Very much disappointed that I took my friends for a treat here.",0
"Visited them on Friday eve, it‚Äôs a two-story store but still seemed over crowded. Guess they are short of staff as required during peak hours.

The bakery offers a set of beautifully decorated colorful cakes, not sure of the taste though. We had a chocolate pastry, veg n chicken puff. Fresh stuff at pocket friendly prices.",1
"A must try for all the ice cream lover. Loved Thier way of Delivering the ice cream, they put ice in the packet , which they deliver ice cream, so it can remain frozen, Awesome Concept, loved it. You could try all menu , but personal favourite is Willy Wonka. Do give it a try guys !",2
Worst biryani and worst serving experience ... Except 3 starters remaining items are very bad... Totally worth less food and time waste .. disappointed,0
"It's good for snacks and cakes..... It's cheap, affordable and reasonable. Not so posh!. Food quality can be better. Service is good and fast. Awesome place for students",1
"We ordered fruit exotica, it was worth the money. Had many fruits overloaded into it. Had many seasonal fruits along with other fruits. Can try this anytime.",2
"I thought of giving ZERO, but there is no option instead I am giving it as 1. Very worst restaurant i ever visited for Buffet. 

If anybody is planning to go for it especially for Non-Veg, I suggest please dont waste your money.

No.of varieties and even the taste is very bad. Coming to the service NO WORDS. They will make us to go for Main Course even though we are not done with starters.",0
"Obviously, Cakes are special. Every birthday, every celebration ends with something sweet, a cake, and people remember.Not a very wow experience with Ksbakers Gachibowli . I liked very few items from their menu. Try Litchi & Dark choclate cakes.
Food - 3/5
Price - 3.5 /5",1
"One of my Weekend chill out place!!
My favourite ice creams are
Nuts overloaded,
Arabian nights,
Dry Fruit Delight,
Ferrero Rocher,
Fruit Exotica,",2
Non veg is worst. Ambience and service is also worst. Taste is bland. You can easily avoid this restaurant. They take so much time to serve food and even they are not polite,0
"Had their chicken tikka hotdog, pineapple cake , egg paneer and chicken patties , pineapple cake , Choco chip cake and bournvita cake was so tasty",1
"One busy place especially in the evenings.
Cream stone has created a special place for itself since beginning. All the ice creams are tasty and the mix ins.

Wide range of ice creams , cream blends, home made waffle bowls and cones makes it unique.

My personal fav are alphonso Mango icecream, death by chocolate and brownie break.

One good stop for ice cream lovers",2
"We went for dinner based on this 4.0 rating it did not meet bare minimum criteria. Food was over spicey/hot even after mentioning the spice levels in first course. Service was very bad. They asked how the soup/paya was and when we mentioned that it is too spicey , that was not bothered and next course was even more spicey/hot. I generally am ok with hot/spicey food but this is very extreme. I would not recommend going to this place.",0
Truly average place. Tried some of their puff pastry and they were good. The items were fresh but the taste could have been better. We went pretty late so didn't get a place to sit as they were in the process of closing down for the day.,1
very good... on time delivery,2
I personally a lazy person who don‚Äôt give a regular review but my taste buds made me to write this review. The only thing that worth was ambience.,0
"An average place to go. Had tried their veg pizza and palak paneer puff, corn puff. Not at all great. I like their miyapur branch. Would prefer the miyapur branch to go",1
Best place for ice cream in the area. The ambience is also nice. The nutty concepts range of ice cream is a must try. The rates are higher but the quality is good.,2
Yesterday bought Rogan josh from here one of the worst rogan josh curry ever. I do not recommend this restaurant. I have tried biryani from here it was ok. Big name bad service.,0
"I had visited this places multiple times and tried a wide variety of items here.
But once I had a burger here which was a disaster, they made it with sweet buns, the veg burger was full of bolied potato and the chicken burger wasn't good either. I barely could finish half of it because the buns were too sweet.
But pizzas and sandwiches always tasted good
It's high time to re work on their burger receipe.",1
Best ever ice cream I have ever had for the last few years and I have a lot of people who feel like me. Ijust love you so much for the great ice cream you have made for me.,2
Attitude problem right from reception/accounts person whoever he is.Burnt food given twice nobdy cares.Take bills shamelessly not even asking why food left as it is without being eaten.,0
Had ordered rolls and puffs from here. Extremely average or below quality. Thou the packing was neat and all but the food inside was so so... give Thee coz they are pocket friendly,1
I loved the taste of qvality of ice cream and i love the response of the restaurant and its delecious mostily i love the afghan nuts ice cream,2
"If there could be an option of zero stars, I would definitely put it. It's a very bad experience ordering from pista house. The food is good, but service is very slow, pathetic and bad. The managers and people managing speak blatant lies over calls for a order on swiggy.
They constantly make the delivery guy wait with false words to both the customers and the delivery partner.
If running a hotel business is so difficult, maybe a change in management would help. Completely ruining the name and brand of pista house.",0
"Pocket-friendly place for a quick round of drinks. Tried their LIIT & Tequila Sunrise, along with a bunch of Chicken, Fish & veg starters. In the drinks, the Tequila Sunrise stood out with a distinct flavor, while LIIT was just the standard one. Would recommend to try the Chicken Nazakath - it lived up to its name with juicy and succulent pieces :-)

The place has 2+2 on Zomato Gold, and offers happy hours every day till evening. So saves the pocket-pinch.",1
Wonderful place for ice creams. My favorite. Would recommend this place to my friends and family. Great ambience. Great taste and consistency of the ice creams is very good.,2
"I‚Äôve been to this restaurant today and had a real bad experience and was really embarrassed as I suggested this restaurant for dinner with family and friends. We had to wait for almost an hour for the placed ordered to be served. At the end, we were not billed for the items we placed order for and the bill was for extra items. It took around 15 mins for the corrected bill with two times to and fro.",0
"We ordered strawberry delight , virgin mojito, crispy corn and chicken 65. Crispy corn was too salty and the chicken 65 was not cooked properly.",1
ice cream got melted even before reaching me...my place is 5 min from creamstone.,2
"Absolutely overhyped place. Substandard biryani and kababs, totally dry and tasteless. No dress code for waiters, hardly any waiters anyway. Pathetic service. I guess each and every place in Hyderabad, which is being talked about, be it pista house or paradise, are totally over hyped.",0
"Very niceee place. Loved it üòç
Its big place spread across 3floors. Ambience is too good. Each floor has different ambiance. We choose to sit rooftop. DJ was keeping the atmosphere good.. But can be more good!
We had chicken n fish starters n drinks. Fish was not so good (had some odd smell), when we informed them, our dish was replaced with chickentikka which was tasty!!
Overall nice place to hangout.",1
"Nice place. Staffs are friendly and create great icecream experience.

Location is perfect just in the heart of Gachibowli. One of the favourite hangout places for people.",2
"Disappointment..being one of the famous restaurant chain, had lot of expectations.We were made to seat on table with dirty table mats and plates.. Food quality is worst to the core. Ordered Mutton Rogan Josh which had excess amount of salt, to our suprise staff was least bothered to act on it or accept feedback. Didn't have biryanis available hence had to sacrifice with steamed rice and dal.
Would not recommend this restaurant as needs huge improvement in terms of food quality, service and hygiene standards",0
"Food is not up to the mark in comparision to other pubs. Veg Manchurian was sweeter than required. Chicken Tikka were not soft and taste was not up to the mark. Sweet Tomato sauce was put on Nachos.
Drinks were quite cheaper then other pubs.",1
ordered nuts overloaded ice cream.fantastic taste.,2
There is a lot of difference between the nizampet and this (Gachibowli) branch.. Too late at serving.. Quality is too poor.. Staff doesn't respond quickly,0
"Place is not so appealing as we went in afternoon and no one was there at this place

There was dust all over the place as some construction work is going on

Food is ok

Ambience poor

Reachability ok

Overall experience 2.5/5",1
Delivery was before time. 5 star for delivery person,2
"Went there for lunch with friends, and not a good dining experience.
1.  Ambience - not like a Fine Dine restaurant - more a quick eatery / Cafeteria place
2.  Service  : Ok.  the person who took the order did promptly mention how much time a dish will take to be served, it is good to be prepared
3.  Food : OK to Pathetic.  we had some starters Paneer Tikka was good and other ones were ok and from my friends who had Tandoori Prawns their Opinion was not so good.  After the starters the Disaster came in the name of EGG Biriyani.  We had ordered for 2 Egg biriyani,  there was no Flavour, gravy or taste in that, it is just a coloured biriyani rice with Fried Boiled Eggs. See the Photo.  It didnt end here, we gave a feedback the Waiter promptly took the bowl back to get some masala in it, and came back and served with masala which was Chicken pieces. Two of us dont eat chicken or meat and it was served on our plates.  

We ended up not eating that second bowl of biriyani except for few spoonful, we were charged for that biriyani, after some discussion they reduced the  price of 1 biriyani from our bill.

Overall not a good experience and dont want to go there again.",0
"Super ambience at rooftop!! üëåüèª
Amazing food.. worth the price.
DJ was nice but IPL took all the attention and so no one danced! üòí
This time overall experience was ok ok i hope its better on my next visit",1
Cream stone is the best hangout place when it comes to late-night drives . Only issue is the place can become a bit crowded and order takes a bit extra time to come,2
"Went for a team lunch. The place is opposite Care Hospital.

Ambiance

This place has normal ambiance as all the other Irani hotels. The problem is that there are a lot of Swiggy delivery boys and they waiting outside the door to collect their parcels. We felt bad sitting there while they were peering inside in the hot sun and us eating there.

Food quality

We ordered three items

1. Devils Chicken
: Chewy chicken coated. This was the best dish of the lot

2. Tandoori Chicken
: fully burnt, coated with ghee to hide the bad quality

3. Premium Biryani: This was really bad. When people go to a Irani style hotel, there are some expectations. We like Biriyani dum cooked. This particular Biriyani costed 650 and came in a slightly large bowl. Please be careful as this can only serve 3 people. The Rice was passable and the Biriyani was fully mixed..... Not the layering like it is supposed to be. It textured like a pulao with the masala . The chicken manchuri in it was cold and the coating had fallen off... You can tell that is was stale. The Chicken pieces were only bones. the mutton pieces were not existent.

This looks like a outlet which is run by fake people.

Biryani and food items in traditional hotels like Paradise, Shah Ghouse, Mehfil, Shahdab, Bawarchi are really good. The tandoori chicken will normally be crisp on the outside and tender on the inside.

The service took a long time in coming. It looks like they are short of staff. People will go there by the name and feel bad. I feel the Pista house owners should look into quality and quantity issues. This outlet is making a fast buck in the Hitech area where floating population is heavy.",0
"Been here on a Thursday afternoon, the place is very different from the pics, indoor seating is congested and uncomfortable, starters in the happy hours can be improved, service is good",1
"Well, I love, love, love ALL the icecreams here. Having said that, I have my favourites. Three to be precise. Death by Chocolate, Chocolate Overdose and Karamel Sutra. When I am on a diet, I get their diet fruit concept icecream- I am that mad about their icecreams. This is one of those places where I gawk on my food and forget to click pictures.",2
Worst service. Strictly nor recommended for family and decent people. Taste is below average. BIG NO for this place.. Stay away. Worst service ever,0
"We visited this place today. A decent rooftop place with good ambience, ipl screening, okayish food and dj. The service is a tad bit slow, giving a resemblance of a place not visited often. Though it was a weekend and strat of ipl season, the place bore a deserted look!
Dj was good and adapted according to the crowd.
We started off with Butter garlic prawns and chicken popcorn. Both of them turned out to be very oily. We further ordered Fish tikka which was okayish. Masala papad was in good quantity and tastier for a change. They wer unable to manage a bunch of hooligan crowd who were throwing beer around unable to differentiate it with champagne.
If you are in a group and want a place not heavy on ur pocket, can opt for PourHouse7.",1
"Cream stone is always best but even when the cake that we require is completed they are still showing the cake on online delivery,it can be changed so that customers don't face any trouble",2
"Went there a week ago. The foods were average i will rate the food a 3 out of 5!

Now come to the service - We ordered 3 butter chicken but they gave us 1, so had to wait for another 15-20mins to get the other butter chicken (please do not compare the taste of butter chicken if youre from north India)

The restaurant looks good from the outside, but inside House Flies will accompany you with your food and friends..",0
"I chose this place because a friend of mine recommended and I was pretty disappointed with the sluggish service as it was not even standard.
There was just one bartender on a Friday night, which really escalated the waiting time. Service on the food section was even slower. As the fries ordered at 9pm were served at 10pm. I was extremely displeased.
If you want visit pourhouse7 then I would suggest going only for dancing and that too only if you can tolerate the high base.",1
"Whenever i have a craving for ice creams, cream stone is the solution! I am a coffee lover so the first thing that i tried here is Coffee craze. The taste was really good and in every bite i could feel the crunch of the nuts. The next thing that i tried here is the Chocolate overdose. It's a serious overdose of chocolate with a delectable scoop of icecream with chocolate brownie. The icecreams are extremely rich and intense. Overall, i do not regret my orders and will continue trying out new flavours.",2
Worst Experience in Parcel of Zaffron Motton Regular Biryani no mutton piecec found i. Biryani bill is 158/- with Gst ... Fooling public in parcel.. dont take pacel frm pista house ... Very Bad experience Simply Looting Public money on parcels of biryani......,0
"Visited this place for a weekend chilling. We called and asked for a dance floor, but after we entered there was no designated dance floor and mostly stags dancing. Our girls were uncomfortable and didn't enjoy much. Maybe a couple's section in dance floor will be good. Food was good and service is decent.",1
"Goo blend of ice cream. Good flavours as well. They have many varieties in fruit and chocolate flavors. Try ice cram, but big NO for waffles. They are very hard.",2
"Worst quality and more oily. Rice quantity is less and pices are more.

Rice quality is also not good. Fully desi pointed .

I won‚Äôt refer to anyone",0
The greek pizza was totally not worth rest was very good.Taste of cheese fries and mushroom was best.prices were too high which was not worth in many other dishes as well.,1
"Cream Stone is always a best place if you are found of variety of ice-creams . Been here for many occasions and when we thought of visiting a place in the late night. 

Taste is very good and prices are moderate and variety of the items are so good .

I would definatly recommend all to visit here.",2
Worst service....i dont know y they have such a stupid attitude towards customers..they r not ready to accept the mistakes they do.food taste is also below average....not again to gachibowli pistha house...,0
Good rooftop location however ambience not set properly.. average service uninterested service managers.. disappointing that it is going down with time. Limited product availability.. mostly you don't get the product that you want to order and they give very limited choice.,1
"I love treating myself to cream stone every once in a while! It's the perfect treat. I've tried almost all their flavors and I love every single one. My favorite would be Willy Wonka (I love chocolate). I'm not fond of their waffles though, but the ice creams are to die for üòã Definitely visit Cream Stone!",2
one of the best worst place...biryani is too worst...but their strtegy is too good...they dont have AC but if we sit and eat the price is double..irresponsible serice...better to go to almas r biryanis...good bye..will never visit again,0
"If you want to visit a place which will have a rooftop setup. Then it is one of the places you can give a visit. The food is okay and even the price of booze is quite affordable. With Zomato gold it would be a great place to visit.
Cheers",1
good timing,2
"Giving this 1 rating for this restaurant is also not needed but giving as it is minimum

we have ordered tangdi kabab and biryani. while ordering we were not informed about the time it is going to take but it took 40 mins. Then we got tangdi kabab with foul smell, after fighting with management we got other plate and it not satisfying. Also same with chicken biryani it is the worst biryani I had in my life till now.

I will not recommend anyone to this place.

PS : First time I am giving negative feedback on any restaurant",0
"Went to Pour House 7 in Gachibowli recently. The rooftop seating is very airy. We ordered:

‚ñ™Virgin Mojito - tasted ok.
‚ñ™Orange chat pat - Tasted yummy!
‚ñ™Chicken Manchow soup - tasted ok
‚ñ™Hyderabadi Tawa Fish - this one was a crowd pleaser but unfortunately couldn't please me :(
‚ñ™Lahsuni Paneer Tikka - paneer tikka was good, flavors were well balanced.
‚ñ™Tangdi Kebab - it was ok
‚ñ™Tandoori Brocolli - this one was impressive. I liked the lemon marmalade that they served with it.
For main course we orderd:
‚ñ™Butter Naan - it was way too thin and oily.
‚ñ™Murg Cashew Nut - Tasted good.
For dessert we had:
‚ñ™ Brownie - the sides were too crispy. Could have tasted better.

Overall, I think there's room for a lot of improvement in their food and ambience. The music can also be better. Hope they will take it as constructive feedback and work at it :)",1
"I have heard a lot about this ice cream parlour from my friends of Hyderabad and Chennai. I didn't miss to visit this place when I was in Hyderabad. I ordered one ferrero rocher. It was like heaven ü§©.
The place is very small for indoor seating. I think , the management should increase their indoor seating arrangement due to their large crowd.

If u r a icecream-lover , this place will be the perfect bliss for you.",2
Shitty place... Shitty service... Shitty management... Not again... Not always brand will work.. Think twice before u check in.. Wrost place in recent times.,0
"This place a great feel to it 
very vibrant and loud
good to have a pool party at this time of the year
amazing place to party
hoping to visit soon",1
A perfect dessert for you and a must have surprise gift for your partner üòç Try the Chocolate over dose and enjoy the pure bliss of Chocolate in your mouth üòã can reduce the sugar content a bit ü§î,2
"In my life the worst exp.. i had as a foody lover. Dont know what quality of basmathi rice they r mixing for biryani i think 30rs 40rs rice itseems
The price of all items is very high..and service is too bad. The food path 50rs biryani is better than pista house.. Chii chii.. I think gachibowli brand is not original. Dear managment plz check with the quality of food and employees",0
"Prism is touted to be the owner of a huge club space, and rightly so.

The place is located somewhere in Financial District, after you take a turn from the Lemon Tree hotel. I pretty much had no clue about where I was exactly, and the almost stranded road is of not much help. Until you suddenly see the big lit up sign with the word Prism inscribed on it, though conveniently covered by the bushes around it. Another 100m or so, you reach their parking yard, and finally the enter the premises after it.

A huge velvety door opens into this big sized covered arena (for a lack of better word), that tell you that it can never get overcrowded on the dance floor. The place has high tables next to the dance area, and then some couches on the far side. There is a beautifully lit up staircase, that leads to a more relaxed lounge kind of seating.

And that is just one part of it. They have an outdoor seating, where the projector is put up for the match screening, and doubles up as the smoking zone. Apart from this, they have a pool, which would be apt for a private gathering.

I am no club expert, but their light system is sure one of their USP. The DJ played majorly Bollywood that evening (it was a Wednesday), and did a decent enough job.

While the place is all decked up pretty well, the food on offer didn't impress me much.

üî∏STARTERS

üîπBurmese Roll with sweet chilli dip: A bit too oily, they were okay to munch on. They could have done with a bit more filling, though.

üîπPunjabi Paneer Tikka with mint dip: Failed to impress. The paneer was too rubbery in some places, and in others, too charred. The lingering taste was merely of chilli, and nothing else.

üî∏MAINS

üîπPrism Special Veggie Lover Pizzaüåü: The dish that fared best with me. It was thin crust and had a good amount of cheese. For the price, it may seem a bit costly, but quite worth it, as compared to other dishes.

üîπSpaghetti: Their take of spaghetti aglio olio, with mushrooms and black olive toppings. This was also decent.

üîπPenne Alfredo: This was just regular, nothing good or bad. And this also goes for the accompanying garlic bread.

I didn't find the Indian mains anything great, and needs to be improved a lot.

The dessert was another downer. Chocolate Truffle was all goey and just cream.

From the mocktails section, I chose the safest bet Go Crazy. It was a twist on the oreo shake, with the inclusion of KitKat, but it wasn't great either. Lacked the comfort of a regular oreo shake.

If you are looking for a party place, that has a happening setup, good crowd and amazing ambience, this is your best bet. But for the food, it is better you stick with safe bets such as pizzas and pastas. They would give you the best value for money. The alcohol is also a little pricey, but you wouldn't mind that in a place like this.",1

"By Invite

The pub is located in the Financial District in Gachibowli, the pub is currently the largest in Hyderabad in terms of area. As you enter you cross your way through a large parking space and pathway to overlook a huge monkey like figure enjoying music.

The pub feels start as soon as a glance falls on the building with colorful lights. The ambience inside is amazing and is spread over two floors with the ground floor having the huge dance floor and pubs and a seating area upstairs. The USP of the dance floor is the literally lit up chandelier made of LED rings grooving to the beat of the music also the walls have lights synced to this.

There is also an outdoor seating where you can watch your favorite matches and when bored head to the dance floor back indoor.

Coming to the Food:

Punjabi Paneer Tikka (Rs. 325):
Thick cubes of paneer marinated with mustard and curd base. Was not soft and requires lot of improvement. A strict no to this dish.

Burmese Rolls (Rs. 275):
A different kind of spring rolls filled with corn, garlic and cheese. The taste was delectable with the right balance of flavors and enhanced by the sweet chilli dip. The only issue was not that crispy and a bit more oily.

Mains:

For the mains we had Exotic Vegetables in Black Pepper with Rice, the curry was just ok had a decent flavor but didn't have the distinctive flavor of the pepper sauce in it.

Prism Special Veg Pizza:
The thin crust pizza loaded with cheese and topped with veggies like zucchini was the best main course that we had among the served. The pizza was decent in taste had not much of marinara base but was not bland either. The pizza was although not crispy as we got busy catching up the tricks performed by the bartenders.

Apart from these we were also served Veg Pulao and Meloni Tarkari curry which was completely average and to be skipped.

Drinks:

Cucumber Coriander Mocktail: The cucumber coriander mocktail was too sweet. The flavor of cucumber had dominated the slight tinge of coriander.

Go Crazy:
The blend of Oreo and chocolates was nothing out of the box and tasted like a regular chocolate shake.

Recommended Dishes:

Burmese Rolls
Prism Pizza (If you need a main course)

The place is highly average in terms of food despite being an ideal place to enjoy the night life. So is not recommended.

Biryani is worst....No A/C...But the prices are the same like a big restaurant...No proper service..owner is irresponsible..They make customers fools with their behavior..most of the ratings might be created ratings as I have seen 80 percent dissatisfaction from the customers..will never visit it again in my life.Their was no ZERO rating so giving 1 rating..My friends and colleagues told me similar response but I wanted to try as it is a big brand.. finally paid for not listening to them.,0
"Big on ambience, food and music. Miserably fails at politeness.

Called up this place to reserve a table for two on a Friday night. They said please walk in. No reservations required for two. The place was sparsely filled but most tables had a reservation, and the ones remaining were well ‚ÄúAbout to be reserved so you can‚Äôt sit‚Äù. If you‚Äôre less than three head to the bar because that‚Äôs exactly where they like pushing everyone to.

The service otherwise is decent but not sure why they are so finicky about holding on to a table that is not occupied .

The place is all lights and show and great for nightlife. The food is decent and the options are a plenty on both the food and liquor front.",1
excellent service,2
"Flies in lime soda
Fish with foul smelling
Chicken lollipop half cooked

Don't go for sea food at this place
Only better item we had was biryani

Food was decent and the starters were average. Location looks odd as its near the ORR and bit hard to find. Service was ok and the interesting part in the ambience is the roof top lights transforms it's shape with music.,1
super delevery,2
"Mutton biryani is taste less you even don‚Äôt feel it‚Äôs a biryani,not at all tasty
Biryani lovers plz don‚Äôt order especially mutton biryani
We ordered chicken tikka it‚Äôs good",0
"I have been on Friday night and reached at round 10pm.
It was almost full we hardly get space for standing.
They occupied huge space and designed interior amazingly which definitely deserve a cover charge as its into business but one thing which nowhere make sense to taking 500 bucks for just entry out of 2k when every items price also decent to take your business ahead.
We could not order any snacks except one as we had to carry on hand and could spoil our party mood.
I must say either they should revoke their concept of charging for entry or should be take responsibility to offer seats atleast when you are visiting as couple or in group.
Dj was playing good track and it was enjoyable moment we spent.
Zomato is showing 1200 for two ppl which is really surprising üòÇ even though you cant step down to this place until unless spend 2k bucks so be aware and keep your pocket tight as this place is not for normal class people üòâ.",1
delivery behaviour good,2
The service is hopeless. They won't even serve water for the costumers unless you ask them. And the manager is also helpless and rude if the costumers complaint. First and last visit to this restaurant !,0
"Been here on a weekday. The ambience is mind blowing. The lights, they‚Äôll drive you crazy ( In a good or a bad way) I was disappointed with food and drinks. Ordered chicken 65 : was very bland, Cajun onion rings : these were decent, French fries : were saggy. The Dj wasn‚Äôt that great. All he played were punjabi songs. Overall, I feel like this place is over priced. The food and drinks weren‚Äôt worth it.",1
"I have ordered several times from cream stone.
One of the finest place for ice creams. Quality and taste of ice creams are top notch. You will fall in love with this ice creams",2

"Oh ho this place serves amazing parathas and their combos are worth it.. You experience it to appreciate it. Lot of crowd at meal times, so u might have to wait 15-20 min for your parantha to be made. But worth the wait.They have a small seating area inside too.",2
"Taste wise they are OK, but I don‚Äôt trust their hygiene. Had ordered through Swiggy and were disappointed with the quality of food. Chicken lollipop was undercooked. There was red blood inside the chicken pieces and had to pull to tear the chicken.",0
I have ordered for kaju biryani through zomato but I received paneer biryani. The taste was good but quantity was very less and they have used excise of oil.,1
"Today I was very hungry as I had to skip my breakfast due to the workload. Moreover, I didn‚Äôt want to spend more than a hundred bucks on the brunch. This was the only restaurant on my mind. You can order a Paratha soaked in Butter with Raita, Chutney and Onions. It is heavenly; all for less than 100!",2
"I am so disappointed with what I just had today from Pista House, Gachibowli, that I don't think it would be sensible on my part to even award a single star rating, but unfortunately, zomato is not allowing me to publish the review without rating , hence this 1 star.

I have had Mutton Kheema Biriyani earlier from Pista House - Kondapur & Nizampet, both of which were awesome and of the same taste & make, however, the same didn't turn true for Kheema biriyani from the Gachibowli outlet.  All my friends who had the biriyani today shares the same opinion, so, I am not being overly critical at all. I don't understand, how such reputed brands/chain do not maintains consistency of taste & recipe across all the outlets, they do maintain consistency with the prices though..

Not sure, if Pista House would be be even interested to take this comment seriously OR act upon it to get things better for next time, but, at least I request that they don't cheat on their customer's expectations.

What was bad with the biriyani -

1. It was all rice and no kheema
2. This is NOT at all the same recipe that is being served in other outlets (Nizampet & Kondapur)
3. Trivial though - but the packaging is also inconsistent as compared to other outlets ( while other outlets packs in Container , Pista House - Gachibowli deliver in foil packet )
 
My order details -

Through Swiggy Order No: #16352555425
, 2 portions of supposed to be Kheema Biriyani .

NO Thanks for ruining the Friday lunch experience.",0
mushroom was not well fried,1
Ordered vada pav and pav bhaji. They had a variety of chats . Both the dishes were too delicious. A good snacks joint in Hyderabad. Their dahi papri should top your list.,2
Very bad service and not that great food. No proper behavior from the staff members. Very poor service. Even the taste of the food was really bad. Nothing great.,0
"Ordered mushroom pander curry but received only mushroom curry, taste was ok but order was not up-to the mark, please ensure it is not repeated again as it loses the credibility.",1
Aloo onion paratha was awesome delicacy to have . Sardarji tussi great ho !! Mouth watering. Would love of you provide some more at cheaper price. Lassi is awesome as well thank you paji,2
"My experience was bad here, they kept us waiting for 20 mins and told that the order we placed for biryani is unavailable.
Same for the sweetdish we ordered.",0
Very bad rotis,1
I ordered dahi bhalla papdi chaat and this is how they packed. They should pack it in a plastic box. The dahi was spilled over the polythene and hardly 20% of the dahi was left in the container. I paid money for nothing. They should give my money back for it.,2
Visited this place on ramadan and we ordered 6 haleem we where 4 all we thought that we can enjoy the real taste of haleem and the bitter truth was the taste was long gone with the moving season .. seriously there is something wrong with this branch too many uncooked bones and intestines . All I can just say is ONE BAD TASTE IS ENOUGH to make all the good once bad ..,0
food is not hot,1
"I love the gol gappe here, At Hyderabad the gol gappe are different they add dal in it where as I am used to masala aloo filling. And they provide it best in Gachibowli.",2
"We went for a lunch outing here. It‚Äôs located at DLF. The ambience is good and we expected a good meal. We ordered Chicken Tangdi, Mutton Biryani and Coke. First thing we got was Chicken Tangdi and what I instantly noticed was that it was deep fried, which is not a norm and wasn‚Äôt juicy; all we could taste was charcoal. This made our expectations very low.

In the mean time, I asked them to get the Coke I ordered; it wasn‚Äôt chilled. Hence, I requested them to get Ice. To my surprise, they had no ice.

And finally, we got our biryani. It was not bad; but, there were no Meaty pieces of Mutton; Only bones.

My advice to you all would be that the food is edible but don‚Äôt keep your expectations too high.",0
paneer too spicy. manchurian an naan were great,1
"If you are craving for a chaat you must visit this place. I tried karara palak chaat, dahi poori and paani poori. Its not as good as we have it in north but definitely a must try.",2
"Well... After going through a lot of positive reviews we finally decided to visit this place. We opted to go for buffet option. The taste of the soup would have been better if it has been served hot. Coming to starters they served 4 non veg and 4 veg starters. Out of the non veg starters apart from Tandoori chicken nothing tasted great or not even good. Especially Apollo fish was not even cooked properly. Out of the 4 veg starters only panner pakoda tasted better, that‚Äôs what my vegetarian friends said. Coming to the main course they served rotis prepared with Maida which I never try. The only thing I liked out of all the main course is mutton curry. Starting from chicken biryani and sweets like Gajar ka halwa, double ka meetha everything was served cold (Probably they forgot to turn on the burners). Finally it‚Äôs ice cream time which melted even before they served on the table. On a whole it was a bad experience. I would like to suggest the management one thing, If you are not really willing to serve buffet option over the weekdays better don‚Äôt.",0
fine,1

"The place is overrated, we went on a Friday afternoon, it was too crowded, had to wait for 15 mins to get a table, once we got the table, order was taken after 15 mins which made it 30 mins of waiting, we had to run behind the waiter to take the order, order was then taken, we had Apollo fish, kung pao chicken and juicy mutton mandi, the fish tasted good, chicken was not cooked properly, coming to mandi, it tasted like we were having boiled mutton with rice, wasn't great at all, and the mandi was around 585rs, I'd rather spend that elsewhere and get 2 mandis for around 600.
Not at all worth, checked the review and took my friends there who were really disappointed.",0

"The food is delicious from this place. Very meticulous packaging. I've tried pav bhaji, chole bhature, and almost all the snacks the place has to offer. Reasonable prices and good food quality. I'd definitely recommend this place to try for various chaats and snacks.",2
"I think the restaurant is over rated. We chose this place based on their zomato rating and ended up being at a place where only decent thing was the ambience.
Being a restaurant, as they call it (I would term it as a local tiffin centre).
They charge you for a buffet when what they have is the bare minimum ‚Äî 2 curries, 1 dal as their main course. BTW, ice cream served in disposable bowl was their special. üòÅ
Food was tasteless, their veg hara bhara kebab was stale. Earlier I felt their non veg would be good, probably the reason for the rating. But to my surprise, my foodie friends (non veg lovers) said it was worse than veg. mind you, it happens rarely with them, they can over rate any average non veg restaurant. But this was worse.
I am forced to believe the reviews are paid.",0

Are you veg. lover, then it will be like paradise for you. They server many varities of Kulcha, Paratha, Vada pav, Sand wich  & Chats. Loved Aloo kulcha and Dal makhani like hell. Paratha and Vada pav are yummy. We have Mixed Veg Paratha and the taste was good with many veggies in it. Vada pav was considerable (nothing can beat Mumbai's vada pav). Had Lemon juice but didn't like that, we have opted for this as there is no Lassi point in time. Over all good food with good price.",2
"The place has either bought paid reviews or the management has changed or something similar, because we went looking at all the reviews here and it was horrible.

And to top it,there werent many items served in the buffet",0

"Amazing chaat and street food just like back in North. The taste and hygiene is awesome, which is why this place is in my list when it comes to street food. Their chats are delicious. I'd ordered pav bhaji, sev puri and vada pav. All was yummy, will recommend this place to anyone who is fond of North Indian food.",2

Quantity is less.,1
"Sardaarji's Chaats & More serves really good punjabi food. If you want reasonable and tasty punjabi food, this place is a really good option in and around Gachibowli. As the name suggests, they have amazing chaats.

I have tried parathas from a lot of places in Gachibowli. And found the perfect places for parathas! But this place not only has tasty parathas, but the price is also very reasonable. The only problem is the packaging. It's not horrible. You can work with it. But comapared to a lot of other places, it is not that great.

Aloo paratha combo had two big parathas, pickel, raita and onions. It was delivered hot and fresh! Papadi with dahi was delicious! The curd was smooth and creamy, not at all sour, and had a tangy sauce added in it. The papadis were very crispy and crunchy. It was topped with green chutney.
The quantity of the chaat isn't a lot. So, if you're really hungry, maybe order two of these or order something else with it.
I'll definitely try their other chaat options soon!

Since, I never visited this place, can't talk much about the hygiene of this place! But overall, the experience was good.",2
"Yesterday we visited this place at 8:30pm. We are 10 people. There was not that much rush in restaurant. If you are going with Zomato gold offer, they will treat as beggar who came to eat without paying any money. Overall very worst experience. Tomato soup with weird smell. We ordered Kung Pao Mahroom as a starter but I can't feel Kunng pao taste in mashroom starter at all. it feels like mashroom chilli. We ordered Baby Corn Masala*2 and Paneer lababadar*2 as Main course and we observed that they served very less quantity compare to other tables as we have zomato gold. They added Baby corn and Paneer pieces which we can easily count. There is more gravy then vegetables, paneer and baby corns as like roadside restaurant usually serve. Even Service is really slow on regular days. I don't know how they manage on weekend. Waiters are very lazy and behaving like they are customers. Best thing is only ambiance.

1. Added few items in between for which we were made to wait for more than 30min with no response whenever asked for. We cancelled the order finally and also were made to pay for the cancelled items (INR 500 extra for the items cancelled).
Reason stated by the staff - if you won‚Äôt pay, it will be deducted from our salary.
2. When asked for salad (thrice), no one served. Ultimately, one of us, went to the buffet section and got the onions. Even this wasn‚Äôt noticed by anyone.
3. Not happy with the quality of food. Ordered ‚Äúpapdi paneer kebab‚Äù as per the staff recommendation. It was dry and not good. We told the guy who served and got no response for our concern.
4. There are many staff members but lack of management.

Highly disappointed.",0
"Ohh finally the wait is over, I have been seeing this restaurant from quite sometime and finally I am at Dine O China. From outside it looks good. I got flat 50% offer from Dine out ""that's exciting""..

First thing to try was Chicken Tom Yum soup.. ohh it was one good tasting soup I had for a while. And then from nowhere we ordered butter garlic prawn.. it surprised me as well.. never seen this in a Chinese restaurant and to no surprise it was HORRIBLE.. battered fried butter garlic prawn with no hint of butter anywhere.. with my experience I would call it a piece of &#-+.. it was all crapy.. and when I asked I got the reply that the Chinese chef has changed... And they replaced the item with chilly garlic prawn.. it was ok for my liking..

Now we have ordered

 Chicken drumsticks

Shezwan chicken dimsums

Singapore noodles mix

Chinese chopsuey

Yang Chow Rice

Schezwan Chicken

To sum up the best item was chicken drumsticks. 

Dimsums where stale and the outer coating was all soggy.

Singapore noodles was more vermicelli than noodles.

Yan chow rice was good

So was Schezwan chicken.

Experience was decent I would say specially with the offer I got.. flat 50% off.

A loud shout out to the dine out team ..

I would wish to come again if I get such offer .. but a friendly suggestion to the restaurant.. please try and make some change as we have very less Chinese restaurant nearby..

"The food of the place was nice except for ‚ÄòMurg Malai Tikka‚Äô, the dish was very sweet and not worth for money.

The staff doesn‚Äôt know how to treat with customers they were unnecessarily speaking and poking nose in our personal conversation and behaving miserably with the people there pretending that is ‚Äúcool‚Äù behaviour.

Overall good place to order food from the last place one should go for dine in. The staff should learn how to behave with the customers.

"Customers won't really care about your ambience or service if your food quality is below par. I ordered Chicken dum biryani from here, relying on their ratings but the very first experience itself was really bad. The chicken tasted horrible and was stale. I had to throw away the biryani. You guys should check the food before delivering it to the customers as delivery of this kind of food does not only affect the ratings but also can cause serious health issues. I value food which is worth the money spent and I feel betrayed here. I contacted zomato regarding the issue and they just assured me that this won't happen again and conveyed that they have shared feedback with the restaurant. They should have issued a proper refund here. I did not expect this kind of service and I really don't look forward to trying anything from this place in future.",0
"I was there today with three colleagues for lunch. The ambience was okay and there were probably more waiters than customers. We ordered the business lunch for two, one chicken option and another sea food option.

Of the four appetizers we shared, I loved the shrimp. Fish was good. I thought chicken was over cooked. We shared two sea food dishes, fried rice and noodles for main course. They were all okay. I asked if I could talk to the chef but was told he is too busy. That was a first.

The waiters seemed friendly and were smiling with the women wearing a bright pink lipstick that matched well with their outfits. Overall, nothing special and keep your expectations right.",1

We get all kinds of street food like Chaat, Pav bhaji, Paratha, Chole bhature, Rajma Chawal etc. We had chole bhature and this was the best that I had in the recent times. If you want, you can get extra chole curry. And the butter milk and Lassi here has the Punjabi essence in it. You will be full after having one plate of chole bhature along with Butter Milk/Lassi.

If you're in search of proper north Indian snacks or street food, do visit and try food from this restaurant. The cost in this restaurant is very affordable. For the quality and taste of the food it serves you will feel that the prices are very reasonable.",2
"I ordered a mutton seekh kebab and a chicken biryani. The kebab was ok ~ 3/5 but the chicken biryani was really bad ~ 1/5. I never waste food. If there is excess, I parcel it but this biryani I just have to leave it and come. Even the chicken pieces are not at all tasty.
The ambiance is average , there are different types of seatings and they had pleasant lighting.
Overall 2/5.",0
good,1
"Delivery by Zomato by quick! They have removed Sandwiches from their menu. Some of the food items are priced high. Overall good experience.
Chole Bhatoore (5/5)

Chole Bhatoore were amazing. Do eat those bhatoore at the outlet itself.",2
I have visited this restaurant with a group of 10 people. I have also ordered from here online. The food quality was not upto the mark for both the cases. The food served to us was stale. The ambience is nice though and the staffs are friendly too.,0
Ambience was quite simple like a Cafe and the order will arrive to your table quick fast. I have tried only chicken dum biryani (becoz my tummy was full) which was good but not great. It can be little more spicy and juicy.,1
"Sardarji's gives you a feel of North Indian chat and Chole bhatoore outlets. They have that similar arrangement outside where everyone have to stand and enjoy their chat,pav bhaji,chole bhatoore on high tables.

I recently visited Sardarji's and tried lot of items of it

Gol Gappe (3.5/5)
Gol gappes were good but the Paani can be made more tangy.They only have one varieties of Paani,and of you want to slightly sweeter version then they will include the red chutney in it.

Aloo Tikki (4/5)
Aloo Tikki was very good. Red and green chutneys were perfect.

Samosa (4/5)

Chole Bhatoore (5/5)
Chole Bhatoore were amazing.Do eat those bhatoore on the outlet itself and the essence is destroyed of you order them at home.Choles are also very tasty.

Looking forward to try more of their items.Their Naan size was huge and other items looked very tempting.

Must visit place if you want to enjoy some tasty chat,chole Bhatoore and that too at a very affordable price.",2
"Ordered mutton Biryani after reading good reviews. And the result is bad. Rice itself was so bland. Mutton pieces looks melting but the aroma and taste of the pieces also bad. So bad that i could not even finish any single piece completely. On the whole, if you are here for mutton Biryani, i recommend not to take. Fyi, I'm Hyderabadi Biryani lover.",0
"A decent place with a regular setup but the pricing is very high. Veg Biryani itself costing at 210/-. It is more like a casual hotel, can't call it a restaurant as it have no ambience, not good tables and chairs. We had Butter Naan and Butter Chicken and the taste was good and service is also good. But the look of the restaurant should be improved.",1
Food here is decent for the price paid. Paneer paratha was awesome and huge. Could easily fulfill even when one is very hungry. Tried others like paneer butter masala didn‚Äôt like it that much.,2
"worst taste , buffet is not at all good , service is too bad, price is not worth with the Food
, please don't choice this restaurant , 1 rating is too much for it !!!",0
Decent place near DLF! Their fry piece chicken biryani is my favourite since I prefer small chunks of chicken in my biryani as compared to one large piece.,1
"A very good chaat and snacks stop, reminds me of north Indian street chaats taste, and am a regular customer here now, especially of papadi chaat, worth a try and you will love it üëç",2
food is not good. we ordered mandi it is worst and mutton is not cooked well. we left the food. and ordered basil chicken it is also cold and not good.. overall a horrible experience going there.,0
packing was not at all good,1
Better to take away or ask for delivery. Cost is fine but the taste is the specialty. North Indians can find their taste and dishes being rediscovered here.,2
"Mandi is worst, mutton is horrible, we orde
red 2 mutton juicy Mandi and we left all the pieces as is. Don't even try
Thanks

Waste of time.",0
"Perfect place at a perfect time! All said once when it was inaugurated as everyone near DLF Hyd had to travel to other places for a good team lunch/dinner.
But gradually restaurant failed to impress the employees and they are traveling again! :D
Nevertheless, Food is better especially the biryani.
Ambience is okay, and service could do a little bit better. They take a whole lot of time to get your ordered food on to the table.

One time visit.

Food - 3/5
Ambience- 3/5
Service-3/5",1
"The perfect north food with perfect Punjabi taste. From the chaat to bhature. All the items are good. If you are looking for North-Punjabi dish, Order. You'll love it.",2
Food was cold and hospitality was bad. Had to wait for soo long to get food. Prefer going to other restaurants than this. Had bad experience.,0
quantity of starters was less,1
Awesome food . I tried chat and samosa and it is one of the best in Hyderabad. Must try and zomato provide the facility to order online which adds to your likings,2
"Food taste isn't good and the staff behaviour is the major let down. They fight and argue with you to give more tips.
Very disappointing. Never ever experienced it.",0
"Good place to hangout in gachibowli. Crowd was average, but ambience wasnt what I expected either. But good food, not budget friendly but worth it as its so yummy.
Has a dance floor, but we need to book it earlier it seems not open for all. That's disappointing.",1
Excellent taste,2
"Too crowded all the time. The crowd management is not that great. Coming here with girls to party sometimes become a risk, especially on the dance floor. Otherwise it is a good place to hang around if you like loud music. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this place for a girls group to go to.",0
"Please don‚Äôt visit this place as a part of official team lunch. We sat in komatose but food buffet was from johnathans kitchen. seating is comfortable for drinks but not for having food. staff was busy serving alcohol as it churns more money, we were ignored big time and were even charged 100 rupees for one kinley bottle. air condition was switched off probably hence we were sweating profusely. My first experience of komatose and johnathons kitchen was bad and would neither visit or recommend anyone for this place.",1
If you are from north and you miss its chat then this place is a must visit for all chat lovers. They have tastiest samosa chat and bhel puri and their pani puri is so so amazing.,2
"The music was unbearably loud. The food was good but the place was overcrowded and the service was bad. Overall, not so welcoming for a comeback.",0
"The place is good. Jonathan's kitchen(restaurant) is attached with that. You can have dinner over there.

Bad thing- services are very slow. You will feel like you are in restaurant not in the bar. The music is also not good according to the environment.",1
This the the beat place to have real #punjabi food. The taste and aroma of delicious food is juat mouth watering. You will not regret any single time to eat here.,2
We went there around 8.30 for having a fun night. But the place turned out to be a cheap place where people are allowed to smoke everywhere. We cant even breathe properly.Then we order vodka..it was like water and when we questioned them he smiled and kind of agreed.Then we ordered Long island Tea and asked him to make it a good one but it was even worse. Even their virgin mohito was not gud.Then the food was also okish.Staff were also not courteous.I find the place was overcrowded. It seemed they have allowed stag entries and they were passing cheap comment on us.I will never recommend anyone here.,0
"We Booked a table at 5.45 but They dint have any data regarding our booking at 8.15PM.
We were made to sit at 2 tables before allocating one. This took about 20mins. We would have went to another place but #hiteccitytraffic.
Happy with the Service & the food.",1
"Nice taste of north indian chaat, rahi bhalle and chole bhature. Chole bhature is one of the favourite for us. Most of the time ordered from here specially for that.",2
"Whole club is a friendly place for smokers which becomes a problem for people who don't smoke.

I went to this club with my friends around 8. It was fine then but slowly the suffocation started. There is no proper ventilation, guessing based on the experience I had. Whichever club, I have been to, there is a separate outdoor place dedicated for smoking. The restaurant or a pub or a club will have outdoor dinning area to address this issue. But here at this place, i couldn't see an open window. It was all dark! I think they really took ""Rogue"" word to another level.
I couldn't enjoy at all, came from there when it was too much for me, now i have got this itching in my throat and cold just because of all that cigarette smoke.
I would really want Club Rogue to address this issue, it was very depressing for me and I think the same was felt by so many people over there.",0
"Went there with some work friends. The place is cozy and attracts business crowd. The food is good for bar menu. The service could have been better. We had to reach out to the staff multiple tomes, to the extent of walking up to them to ask for stuff.
The ambiance is nothing to write home about, but it is ok.",1
Really good with the taste and the quality!! Pocket friendly and worth giving a try!! Dal makhani with rice is what I would recommend to try!!,2
"Ambience sucks... Worst service.... They don't book tables and when I asked a waiter for a table for 4, he just ignores and stares away... When we managed to make a waiter arrange a table for us, he just keeps a table in the middle of the way and asks us to stand throughout our course for the evening... Well we finally made to a normal table by waiting for others to vacate.... I highly recommend not to go to this place.... Just sitting outside the building and talking to my friends was lot better than ruining our evening by going to this shitty place...",0
The ambience was good but bar tenders were rude on ladies night. Treating us like they are the ones sponsoring us drinks. Need to improve their service,1
excellent delivery,2
"Been to Club Rogue last Saturday I.e. 13th April 2019. We chose this place as it was a Bollywood night. Lot of things to get told about this place.
First, coming to the ambience. It's a nice big place. The pricing is reasonable. We were given a place of our liking after a little followup.
Now coming to the attitude & rules of the club. The entrance has a prominent display which says, only couple allowed in after 7pm. Easily 10 bounces at the entrance, but inside- NIL! In spite of the display board saying only couples, they have allowed stags in. The dance floor was unchecked. Anyone could dance, feel you or ogle at you and not one single staff to monitor anything.
The Bollywood songs started at 11.10pm! I don't know what were they waiting for till so late to start playing Bollywood music.
Overall, a nice place but definitely enter this place with caution & at your risk & evaluate your need to visit this place.
Service was good. We were attended to well, by our server Mr. Kunal.",0
Ambience is okay .. no dance floor .. average music . No energized atmosphere . A class place for people who want to drink in peace .. paneer was good .. peanuts were good,1
"Hyderabad and Good North Indian Food! Was wondering where will I find such good North Indian Food until I landed to this place!

Taste : Ordered chats and Dal Makhani & Alu Kulcha Combo.. Must say such tasty Punjabi food made me very happy!
Service : Good Service!

The counter is busy on Weekends totally!! If you crave for Punjabi Food, this is a MUST VISIT place!!!",2
Manager was so cheap n attitude showing ego to the guest ..we visited thrice this time .. management pliz take serious action to the manager or else he vil let the business down..,0
I have been here couple of time!! The inside seating is very small but the DJ is good. They have beautiful outdoor seating. Food wise it‚Äôs average nothing fancy about it. It‚Äôs a place to just hangout with friends and chill. Expectations for high quality food should not be there.,1
The best vada pav I had in gachibowli. Chaats are just awesome. You will love Alu kulcha with Dal makhani although they should increase the quantity of Dal makhani but overall it's a great place to eat.,2
"Recently been to this place. Good food and economically priced. Service was also good.
Most disappointing part is their crowd management. When they have a board outside only couples after 7.00p.m and then u see 60 percent dance floor is full with stags. No bouncers to check what is going on floor. Stags misbehaving with girls, trying to feel them, smoking on floor, no one is there to look around. Just for their business they r letting everyone in.
I will never visit this place with my wife/lady friend. As there is no security for them. One should enjoy the party but with some limits.
The management should look into this aspect and try to sort it out or else the place will become like its name a Rouge place. Lot of cheap crowd on Saturday night better to avoid.",0
These stars are just for the food and drinks. I just don't like the service and attitude of the staff or rather just our luck that we encountered the same person twice. Almost threw the order on the table when prepared. Even the food he served was without any accompaniments that were supposed to be there. Drinks are good..food is ok..zero stars for the service!,1
"Ordered via Zomato delivery. Great taste and packaging. However, Portions can be increased a little though. Also dude no onion or green chutney along :(",2
"I am at this place @1:38 Friday 12th. My girlfriend ordered Mango Blossom, this bar tender here adds chat masala in store bought mango juice.

How does the word blossom relate to chat masala.

Disgusting treatment here at club rogue",0
The ambience is nice but overall experience on a ladies night was not satisfying.I ordered double deck pizza with LIIT.The food was delicious.The music was good.,1
"It was the second time i ordered something from here, and both the times food was delicious , first time i ordered for an alloo paratha it was huge in size and wasn't able to eat full , and this time ordered aloo cheese sandwich , it was yummy , loved it , will definitely try some other things from here.",2
"Cheap place.
Really bad service.

This place has a quiet weird rule. If you show your office ID card they‚Äôll not be charging a cover amount. Else you‚Äôll have to pay a cover charge.

The bar attenders are so ill mannered, I was almost about to slap one.
If you can‚Äôt talk to a customer politely, then maybe you should not work at a bar!
I‚Äôve asked for a Budweiser but he gave me a kingfisher and then insisted that I ordered kingfisher. (I‚Äôm okay with the argument part but he said drink it or get out which made me furious).

Food was average and served medium hot (I think I was served someone else‚Äôs cancelled order item)

Music was terrible! There was some desi dj who was playing songs out of YouTube and there was no quality mixing.

Ambience: 3
Service: 0
Management: 0

Will I visit this place: NEVER
Will I recommend this place: HELL NO!",0
"Komatose! Sigh.... :(
I had high expectations by seeing the rating but unfortunately the menu, place and the crowd was very dissapointing.
We like the fried Mozzarella... couldn't find anything better or unusual :/
Well this is not a separate restaurant, they use one single restaurant by two names.
ONLY WHAT MADE ME GIVE A 3 RATINGS was the LIVE MUSIC (bollywood beautiful voice of the singer)
Sorry Komatose üôè
Aditi",1
"This is something one would definitely like... they serve n number of variety in north indian food. Must try once they will never disappoint you, l bet",2
"The food and drinks are good.
The ambience is great too.
But the place feels too crowded and the dance floor sucks.
The DJ music is alright.
The staff is not good and need to be given proper training.
The way they rush guests out after 12 is too bad.",0
"This place is located in khajaguda. It used to be one of my favorite places because of the taste, quantity and pricing. I used to visit this place every weekend or in fact twice a week.

Food is no doubt good..their soups, starters dal makhani, etc.. However there has been a drastic change in the prices all of a sudden.

Prices have been almost doubled . I used to have a dal makhani at 180 rs and now its priced at 300 rs.. I believe the management needs to seriously rethink if increasing prices by almost 50% is really a good decision with no changes in ambience. ? I believe their main USP was good food at affordable prices at a decent ambience.. Even other restraunts like sardarji ka dhaba and Moti Mahal have lower prices and better ambience..

With hike in prices, customer expects a sophisticated and improved ambience, fancy cutlery on the table .. well decorated tables , and much more to look at such as clean washrooms to use, well dressed waiters.. etc..

Hope the management would rethink..",1
one of the better places to go for north Indian style paranthas. Chat is also good not that great though if you want north Indian style. Have been here quite a number of times and always find it crowded. Has never disappointed.,2
"Thrice I visited this place thinking it might change my opinion but as always it was a disappointment. The staff and the manager extremely rude the service really bad. Looks like the place does not need customers at all coz I haven‚Äôt come across any waiter who would refuse to serve. Complained to the manger who was equally rude !
Food and drinks are alright but I got wine served in a plastic foggy glass üòì I go out for the experience when I spend money üí∞. I‚Äôm not sure about the others but I had a horrible experience.",0
I've ordered Chinese nonveg combo from this place ...it's basically veg fried rice with chicken Manchurian gravy....the foods aroma was awesome.... however the vegetables were undercooked and spoilt the taste of the food... However I really liked the food...it was flavourful..will definitely order from this place again,1
"Had samosa, Pani puri & Kulcha comBo here.
Best food !
Hygiene wise a bit low. Food was far better to ignore all other lows.
Highly recommend!!",2
The manager named Siddarth was treating us very badly. We went with a few girls. The other guys around were teasing our friends. When we asked him he said he can't do anything. He does not have minimum courtesy to talk politely with the customers. The staff lack basic professionalism. One of my worst experiences.,0
The quality of food they are offering has degraded. I was the one who wrote good feedback about the restaurant once and was a frequent visitor... But now because of poor quality offered twice I stopped going there,1
"Punjabi food gets you?Well go there soon then. Their chole bhature and club grilled sandwiches are something which are really amazing even the best joints can't beat.

There's no ambiance or proper sitting but it's worth it!",2
"I went to club rouge since the day it started,I have been to this place more than 150 times.It was like a hangout place for us to always go.It was beautiful in the starting,less crowd and only couples were allowed to dance floors and people dint stand on tables and all that time to dance.Bouncers were pretty good at that time and the manager at that time was also very nice and polite.In the past few months since the manager changed,his name is siddharth the club rougue we knew was no more there.This angry little manager is the worst human u could ecer talk to.Single girls beware to go to this place.They allow cheap bastards into the club who doesn't drink and doesn't even have a table,they keep roaming all around the club to find girls and talk with them or make em uncomfy by staring at them and not moving from there table.I even saw a guy putting a tablet into some girls drink.Coming to my incident,Yesterday i went to this place to watch afternoon ipl match which was at 4.We went there at 5 and it was happy hours,which we don know or never cared about happy hours in clubs.We started watching match and at 6 a waiter comes saying pls pay bill since happy hours is ended.We said okay and we paid.Now the waiter says please leave, we were like wtf we came to watch the match and we will leave only after it's done.Then he calls the manager.His name is SIDDHARTH.This guy is one horrible crap who thinks since he is the manager of the club he's an avenger superhero.He came to us and said which a very tone u people have to leave,I told that's not happening we are hyderabadi's and it's srh match and we will leave only when it's done and he started shouting and telling no with so much attitude.Later he said 30mins and left.He wasn't coming when I was calling him also.He comes after 30mins and says go,When we told we will not leave until the match is done he told he will call bouncers and make us leave,We were so frustrated and angry we told call them and let them decide who's wrong here.Then he told that club rougue owner(MD) is NARSINGH RAO and he is a big local goon and he threatened us that once u leave this place some unknown people will come and hit and break our bones if we say anything to SIDDHARTH (the manager).People go to clubbing to have fun and in the end all we got was a life threat.And moreover this place became a sick place,it stinks and waiters will force u to give more tip saying 2 ppl served u and all.And the cheap guy stags who come inside with influence and think they are hottest models üòÇ.Sorry for the long review but i think they deserve it.The manager SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH.SIDDHARTH Thanks for making me realize that i should never come back to club rougue and make bills around 20k each time I visit the club.And thanks for making me realize that I should not suggest this place to anyone.His name is SIDDHARTH and the he is HERO of club rougue.",0
"Have visited this place few times last year. This is a decent dine-in joint. The food you get here is a normal indo-Chinese food, which any Chinese restaurant would serve. If you want VFM, go there and dine-in. Have always felt that the quantity of takeaways are less than dine-in. The picture is a quantity you get for 320 bucks dish!",1
Delivery on time,2
"Bad reception and unprofessional staff,do not visit this place they are unfriendly they just loot your money and the prices are also very High",0
"I order from this place all the time, never visited though.
Food 4/5
Price 3/5 overpriced.
I really liked there Paneer biryani and all starters.",1
"ordered Sev Batata Puri, Mumbai Vada Pav, Mumbai Samosa Pav, Samosa Cheese Grilled Sandwich and Veg Club Grilled Sandwich....taste was good....not spicy as preferred.......only disappointed with the packaging",2
the manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly. And called bouncers upon us coz We justed wanted to see the match. The reception is bad. No ethics at all,0
"This place started as a great place initially, but in recent times the quality and quantity have been reduced.
One of their best dishes "" Sarson ka phool"" is the best example of this category.
You need to go back to your basics else you will loose the customers slowly",1
"Wahh ji waah! Dilli ki yaad dila diya apne toh!

After staying in Delhi for 3 years, I was looking for a chatwala in Hyderabad. Here I found the chatwala now. The taste can be improved, but something is better than nothing.",2
"The manager was unprofessional and asked us to leave abruptly and called bouncers upon us. The ethics, courtesy and reception were very bad.",0
"This place is tough to find. Due to constructions nearby and it is a normal hut styled place. Don't go by the pictures.
Food is average. Few items very bad mainly their special biryani. Oh my god it was undercooked and chicken was terrible.
It is not so happening place.
Their main course chicken and veg curries are good and adequate quantity.

P. s: they are good for delivery, yet if u can skip there are good places nearby.",1
If you crave for some Mumbai style chaat then this modest place is for you. Absoultely pocket and taste bud friendly. I would definitely recommend this for a casual snack time. Yet to try the main course here.,2
Went to this place to watch ipl match which was at 4pm and once happy hours ended they told us to leave.There were more 10 overs left and they told us to leave.Then manager came and he shouted at us and he din tell his name also.We told we will leave after match he called 6 bouncers to send us out.He was shouting as hell and abused us.I have been to many clubs but this kind of attitude that too in a cheap place like club rougue is lame af.Please ignore this club if u wanna have a good time,0
"Tasty food but expect less quantity compared to price.
It is on the middle of kajaguda to nanakramguda. Not crowded and big. Very small restaurant.",1
very impressive delivery. Amazing work,2
"Me and boys went to watch match here, we are regular customers here. But manager asked us to leave abruptly in between the match. He called bouncers upon us which was totally unnecessary. Can't have a good time here. Won't recommend this place.",0
"Ambience: Not great, by seeing photos we expected more out of it but it didn't match our expectations. It was dark and sort of out of order too.
Rating : 3/5

Food: We reached here just to have sizzlers as we wanted it and could find only some on the list being this one of them. We took sizzler again it was not what we thought of it was just about fine. Then we ordered panner tikka and something in non veg starters. Starters were good they grilled properly baked properly proper taste. We ordered some curries and naan again the main course was just about fine not great. Overall we only liked starters here.
Rating : 3/5

Service: It was bit slow we had to wait for quite some time for getting our order at one point we thought that maybe they are outsourcing the food also üòÖ
Rating : 3/5

Overall: Place is bit hard to find and food it is not that great it is decent for you to explore. But not the first choice.",1
"Great place to have good chat. Very well made dahi papdi and aalu tikki, especially because their dahi tastes very fresh and feels like home made. Only order one full paratha for yourself if you're extremely hungry, though the filling is great but it is very heavy.",2
Too crowded.. Don‚Äôt even have place to dance. Music is good but since it‚Äôs too crowded you won‚Äôt be able to dance.. They should manage the crowd to make it good,0
"the food is great but it took almost 45 min to se
rve,ambiance is good, Zomato gold is accepted address is pretty simple. tandoori chicken is very tasty .",1
Got the chole bhature for ‚Çπ 66 only through FAV50. Was craving for some good old punjabi flavour and this was perfect.,2
"So this is not the review for good music/ambience/food/drink.
This is for the manager who was outside at the gate. 23rd March, 2019. We were three friends, and the bouncer at the gate asked for company ID, as we were stags. One of my friend called another, who was on the way, whether he was carrying his ID proof.
In the mean time that Manager appeared at the gate.
We went to the gate and showed the ID, but he looked at us head to toe, and made a disgusting face and asked for 2k cover charge. Without any reason.
Some other stag groups were entering; just showing company ID.
But this manager asked 2k cover charge from us, and we saw, he did same with another three guys group.
We didn‚Äôt make any nuisance there, and silently left the place.
So , tell me Club Rogue why this discrimination?
Is this the way your managers handle clients?",0
"Starters were good. The main course lacked salt and a bit of lemon juice. We ordered the palak paneer. I've had food here once before and it was amazing then, so this time, it was a slight disappointment. Last time I had the chicken tikka which was really amazing.",1
great good!!,2
"This is otherwise a good place, but all the waiters just always try to steal money by overcharging you for the items that you did not buy. This happened with me couple of times, they charge you for things you did not order, don't return the money and then argue with you.

I have seen this happen to others. Just be careful with the waiters and bartenders on this one, they seem to be bunch of thieves. This place is otherwise a good and joyful.",0
Ordered Schezwan Chicken Via Swiggy Last Night. The Taste is Bland. Neither Good Nor Bad. Just Okay. The Quantity is way Less for a 210 Rupees Dish.,1

#RamadanSpecial
#Reviewmode

Bbbq nation has come up with all new DAWAT -E - RAMADAN Where they've bought in few of the best Street foods of Ramadan which really makes one visit and satisfying their foodie soul's!

I was pretty excited to try out their Ramadan special menu and the moment I enter I see a Big Raan marinated well on the pan and sizzling hot Mutton Chops searing on ghee! That view Enticed me and I just walked toward it to see that beauty happening. I couldn't wait to try that Super appetising Chops and delicious Raan!

Besides they also got chicken Shawarma and MUTTON HALEEM Which is another different delicacy storyline...
I had to take a big bowl of Haleem with some birista and dash of lemon squeez and Final touch with Two spoons of Ghee. Yes that's my style! üòâ

I walked to see few more exciting dishes and I found the legendary Badami Gosht! Yes just the glance of it made my mouth water and besides Murgh Mussalam was also calling me with its own aroma, that spread of cream on it made it look like show stopper and make anyone try and lick their fingers...

Cannot miss Thier Gosht Biryani üòã one fine plate of heaven where every spice and meat married so well. Perfectly tender meat and soft and Fragrant basmati with a touch of Ghee!

Only because of the taste and being foodie I had two rounds of everything and was full...
But there's always a another stomach for kulfi!
Pan-Pista-malai, Voila!",2
"1. Bollywood music starts only after 10.30 pm. Dont fall for the incorrect timings posted here. Before that, its routine boring music which is unnecessary loud and you cant converse
2. Theres no outdoor or smoking zone, so be ready for a lot of passive smoking
3. DJ is okay (we went there on a Saturday) not many latest songs in the list. If you're' a bit away from the dance floor, you wont hear the music properly.
4. Food & ambience & service is fine.
5. Drinks are below average. LIIT was okay.
I asked for fresh lime soda with salt only and even after returning once, i got it mixed with sugar syrup and without fresh lemon.
6. They serve wine and cocktails in cheap dirty plastic glasses. It totally put me off",0
"If you have no value for money then this restaurant is good to waste your money. Reason for giving 3* is due to veg curries which were told be good by my vegan friends. But, we, non-veg guys were totally disappointed for non-veg curries. It's got no taste at all. Chilli chicken gravy was like saucy-saucy. No spicy at all. Butter rotis were thicker than it usually has to be. It tasted like wheat flour and not maida.

Service- Good
Taste- Below average
Ambiance- Good
Cost- High",1
"This is one of my favourite restaurant with grill concept. Ambience was really fascinating ,food quality was too good , my favourite recipe is grill pineapple it is delicious.",2
Staff was very rude. Confused the order and asked our group to leave. Worst service staff I've seen so far in Hyderabad. STRICTLY DO NOT RECOMMEND.,0
"Starters were good and especially tandoori items were best of the menu
Curries were just okay and biryani is a very a big disappointment.Never try it. Service is good and staff is very courteous.",1
"Have been a huge fan of this chain since 2013. Have been to the restaurant in different cities, and have noticed some significant differences across all locations.
This Gachibowli BBQ Nation has some items missing from its live counter, but have curd rice which wasn‚Äôt available in any other location I have been to.
The staff is extremely courteous. We were served by Rajib, who was really warm, quick in his service.
The overall quality of the food was satisfying, just like most of the other outlets I‚Äôve been to.",2
"The DJ that came on around 11 PM yesterday night (some lady) was a terrific disimprovement over the guy who was playing right before she. Killed the buzz for us entirely (and for many others, too, visibly). Liked the ambience, though. Would want to visit again iff the same DJ never presents themselves again.",0
Too Spicy,1
"As usual it's fab place to have grill in a buffet. Non veg is awesome here. Chicken, Mutton, Prawns, Fish are served on the grill. Some days you also get crab curry. Now they opened tawa starters as well.

Nice place to go for team lunch/dinner.",2
So unprofessional place being a girl I felt the staff was inappropriate on behaviour and I love the Dj anyways over there but the staff is making the place worst so freaking rude,0
Food packaging and providing sufficient packets of raita according to the order,1
"This is an amazing place for Veg as well as Non Veg starters. There are so many varieties in it. As you will be already full, you don't generally go for Main course and also it's very average. I really love their service. Suppose you don't like item, they will replace it by customising according to your requirement.",2
"They serve you wine in plastic glasses. Staff is very rude and unprofessional and they literally force you to pay exorbitant tips at the end. Was a loyal customer earlier, never coming back here ever again. Try 10D or the lal street instead (in the same building).",0
Had ordered Hunan chicken starter received gravy,1
Service was excellent biriyani and service excellent very nice food very good staff and servise drinks was excellentb.bq chiken very test and fish pine apple very test service and food quality is excellent,2
"Visited the place on a weekday but it was jam packed with people. The music was too loud to the point that we would not able to discuss on what to order across the table. I have been to many places but never had such loud music. My ears were ringing after coming out.

The service was the worst.. All of my friends went to the dance floor and I was stopped by the staff who asked not to leave the table and asked me to deposit my id card. This was pretty humiliating. This place probably sees too many dine & dash incidents given the kind of crowd it caters to.
The food was average at best.
They entered ‚Çπ200 as tip on the pos machine trying us to pay that for this s***ty service.
The valet meddled with my car's infotainment system.
I will avoid this place from now on and stick to more classy places.",0
"The place gives you a feeling like you are having food at a royal Arab resta, the food here is aptly cooked but the required seasonings are not provided(fried onion which are main in a Mandi) and also I have seen them filling tap water in the bottles and serving the same as bottled water , so watch out at last you can rate the food at 4/5 , seasonings 2/5, ambience 1/5 at last it is a great place to go with family and friends",1
Was wife's birthday and our anniversary as well.. Naresh and Bipul made it point to make it extra special. The hospitality and the culture of the employees keeps taking me back there forever..,2
"The staff is not at all friendly As we entered we asked for place and no one even responded to us order was taken after almost an hour and the straight no answer it‚Äôs very rude added they don‚Äôt have half of the things in menu available. Place being popular amongst the crowd even on weekdays must ensure to meet the menu mentioned food items and sometimes we specially come to try those food items and also serving cold food is a big disappointment
So I think if the place gets the humbleness and little more friendly it would add on.",0
"Have been here once. The staff was courteous and very friendly. Overall the theme was perfect and sets the Arabic mood. I think they can work a bit more on offering more choices, felt that the choices were limited apart from the mandi it is known for. Limited veg options too.",1
"This place always exceeds expectations!!! Friendly staff, customised orders and finger licking good food!!! And of course you need a second stomach for the desserts!!!",2
"I am thinking where to start, there were so many bad experiences at this place in just 2-3 hours of time we spent there. We were a group of 8, we decided upon this place after looking at the reviews and on recommendation of someone who had visited a few months before us.
To start with, the place does not have well groomed and professional staff, they hardly understand what you speak.
The first bad experience was when we entered and got ourselves seated on a large table meant for 10, we were 6 at that time and 2 more expected to join us. As soon as we got seated, a waiter came to us and asked us to take a smaller table as this one is meant for 10 people, we told him that we are expecting 2 more to join shortly, but he insisted we take a smaller table as crowd would start coming, it was not even 6 PM then and there was hardly anyone at that time other than the 6 of us. We told him that incase more crowd comes we will move.
Secondly, we ordered for drinks and those were served in plastic glasses, when we asked for glass ones the waiter they don't have any. We had to literally fight for glass tumblers and they did it very reluctantly.
The service was slow, we had to keep looking for waiters.
We were there during happy hours and were told it ends at 7 PM, but the waiters stopped taking orders at 6.50 PM saying by they serve it would cross 7 PM. Doesn't that sound ridiculous?
Again they started serving in plastic glasses and we were demanding the glass ones, when the argument was not stopping I suggested my friends that we should go to 10D, to which the waiter present said we should go to 10D they use glass tumblers, after he said that we demanded meeting the Manager.
The Manager came and he was a nightmare, he did not have the courtesy to apologize on behalf of the waiter and started arguing with us, when we said we will give bad rating/ review the Manager said ""Ok Sir, we are also dangerous people"" we were shocked at this.
Our evening was spoilt already, so we decided to move out of there and go elsewhere.
This place is not at all professional, the staff and their business ethics are horrible, will never visit ever.",0
"I just wonder how people praise the food and service.
Maybe the day was different for me but I was really very dissapointed with the service they had given. We asked for raita and we were served after we almost finished our mandi. I hate such late servings.
Mandi was all overhyped with taste being not that great. Instead I find it better at other places.

Ambience wise it is nicer than other mandi restaurants. However the choice of music could have been better.

Overall I would say its just a waste to ur pocket and palate.",1
"It's Barbi boss...no comments.
It's was sudden plan from Gang to visit this place, fortunately that day was 10 years celebrations day of BN.
We got some discount on bill also. We all from coastal area basically and sea food lovers.
Believe me or not, I loved and felt happy wit prawns here...yummy and yummy.
It might silly...we did justice to my money, may more also.
That was a weekday and I want to try this place on some weekend",2
Worst place in Hyderabad. Staff has no etiquette‚Äôs to talk to customers. No idea about what is available and what is not in their drinks menu. Takes more than 30 minutes to get your order. Horrible experience,0
"The place is a bit isolated but the food and ambience is quite good. Even one of the best place to have the Arabian Mandi. Give a visit for sure, I would say.
Fahm Mandi - less spicy
Barbaque chicken Mandi- If you don't mind having a bit spicy. My personal favourite it is.",1
"Had to wait a bit to get a table that's a good thing üòÑ, great food and best service such a great staff Sudeep Roy, Naresh ur a star I have seen him doing everything keep up the good work guys",2
"Ambiance is good. There is a dance floor with a good DJ. Food and drinks quality is good and price is ok! But service is very bad, stuffs are not at all polite and not cooperative. Even they force to pay tips and use to bargain for the tips which is very unprofessional. We did not find any manager as well..",0
"Arabic feel-
Ambiance-
Yum yum tree is one of the best restaurants in Hyderabad specialised in Arabic Mandi. Yum yum tree has one of it's outlet at Gowlidoddy, exactly above Art Botique hotel. Yum yum tree has one of the finest ambiance in Gachibowli area. Indoor as well as outdoor sitting is available. Live sports screening is available at the terrace.
Food-
Yum yum tree is famous for it's Arabic Mandi, they also serve various kinds of starters and shawarmas. We placed an order for Chicken Stick Mandi and Chicken Barbeque Mandi. Chicken stick Mandi has 6-7 boneless chicken pieces, which were tasted perfectly with Mandi rice. Half Chicken barbeque Mandi included 2 large barbeque chicken pieces served with 2 types of gravies.
Service -
Service at Yum Yum Tree Gachibowli is average, as they take more time to serve starters.",1
"We went to this place as a part of corporate outing. It was my first time to Barbeque Nation. I must admit that I was pretty much humbled by the chef coming over very often and asking if the food was up to our satisfaction. The starters alone were enough to fill up my belly. When it came to having the main course, the options were not many but it suffficed, I would say. The waiters were patient enough to serve us whatever we needed and we all left with a happy note and fat bellies.",2
"Very unprofessional and rude staffs. If you order 2 beers, they will insist for a bucket and if you do not order a bucket, they will take half an hour to bring your order. The place is overcrowded during weekends and there is no proper crowd management of any sort. Then the waiters say that because it is overcrowded, orders can't be processed properly. Despite all that inconvenience and bad service, they force you for paying the tip and even argue over how much you want to pay. Crowd is very indecent and sometimes vulgar and there is no provision for crowd control given that the place is overcrowded. Music and DJ is good with cheap food and drinks, which is a crowd puller. One can have a really nice time if you can bear all these and if crowd is what attracts you.",0
"Visited YYT with my family for Friday dinner. Was longing to have Mandi for long. The restaurant is located close to Q-City amidst the residential property but still attracts good foot fall. The d√©cor is simple yet beautiful. Generous staff. We ordered half chicken mandi and later an extra chicken piece, it was more than sufficient; needless to say it was heavenly. Would love to try desserts from the menu specially baklawa. Good place for get-together. Request the staff to maintain clean washrooms and dining/seating area.",1
"Barbeque is mostly my favorite but if I compare barbeque nation with Abs , sahib's barbeque... obviously I have to give one point less to this one...food is good but limited items..but if you have kid go there my son and my friend's kids enjoyed a lot there they were given car and balloon by staff and lots of fruits and french fries...they enjoyed to the core... ambience is gud service excellent...

Food 3/5
Ambience 4/5
Service 5/5",2
"Very unprofessional and arrogant staff.
It takes 30mins to take order üôÑ
Staff is so careless towards customer. Ambience also not that much great. It's a chillar pub. Not recommend for couples.
Crowd is tooomuch because it's they allow stags aswell if you show your office id.
It's a budget friendly.",0
"Visited with my friend in weekend and it's my 1st visit to this food court... firstly Ambience was impressive so that I had started taking selfies.. coming to Service just OK
And food taste was not up to the mark ..",1
"This Place was really amazing, as usual the staff is very polite, Appreciate their work in maintaining professionalism, loved being serviced by Saif Ali Khan and staff..",2
"This is the worst place i have ever been too.
Such a illiterate crowd and the management is too fucked up and i'll never visit this place and never suggest this place to anyone.",0
"This was my first visit to Yum Yum Tree restaurant, and food was ok. We were three people and ordered Sheesh Tawook starter & Chicken BBQ Mandi, overall good experience.

Food 3/5

Ambiance 3.5/5",1
Been to the place recently. The service was on a slower side strangely but the food items on the grills taking a little longer to arrived. Food good as usual,2
"We were there in a group of 9, for drinks last weekend. And we had the most horrible experience ever. Happy hours were till 7, but they were very reluctant to take any orders in the last 30min.We had to call them repeatedly, and then they came dragging their feet. When we were placing orders at 6:50pm, they said, it wasn't counted under happy hours. No explanation given. Shady ambience and very diluted drinks Food was OK. The worst part is that they were serving the drinks in plastic glasses, real shabby ones. We asked for proper glasses and they told us to go to 10D.. I mean.. Really?? Asking 9 customers to get lost?? We were unhappy with the server's response, and wanted to talk to the manager, who was even worse. He outrightly threatened us saying they were dangerous people and it would not be safe for us.. Really!?! LIKE REALLY???
Anyways we got the hell out of there and went somewhere else.. But it was a very unpleasant experience. Club rogue indeed has rogues running it. Would advise everyone to stay away.",0
"Arabian touch to a sumptuous feast! A great place for team outings and the Mandis will make your team work totally worth it. Good taste in food and great ambience. Service could be improved a notch. The Mandis will fill up to 3 people and is worth the penny. Courteous staff and great seating arrangement. Best visited in the night. 

P.S. Don't get flabbergasted by the looks of the Mandi

Personal favourites: Chicken BBQ Mandi, Mutton Juicy Mandi. Fairly good shawarmas (sp. chicken cheese shawarma)",1
Inside Atmosphere is good....and serving and way of treating everything I loved it.....and very reasonable price for parties..we can enjoy with friends....,2
"The worst place in the city, I was here for a few drinks with my friends and it was during the happy hours (which is till 6pm) and they were so adamant in taking our order at 5.50 stating happy hours were closed, we had to literally tell them that we were still in happy hours to ask for that price, surprisingly they didn't like it and the drinks were diluted. What surprised me the most was that they were serving everything in plastic glasses? Like seriously? Serve drinks in a plastic glass? When speaking to the waiter he said - go to 10D they serve drinks in glasses and not plastic, it was so rude for him to say that. I asked him to call his manager and told him the story to which he says his boss asked to serve in plastic glasses and kept explaining that it was his boss's order, he was just not able to understand what I was explaining to him - I bigger issue was about the way the waiter had spoken to me and when even after sometime I realised he was not interested in what I was saying, I was furious and used F word to which he said you can use F word but we are also very dangerous people? Like what dangerous? He was absolutely okay with me writing this review as they felt they didn't have any obligation towards customer service. It was not something they were giving me for free and to compensate he was willing to give me discount and also call the waiter to apologies to me - I didn't need someone's apology - what matters the most is their service and looks like it does not appear anywhere on their list of how to sustain in the business. Disappointed!",0
"This is an Arabian themed Restaurant and is located near QCity, Gachibowli and is exclusively known for its MANDI. üçõüçö

They have different varieties of Mandi and the restro is designed very well with eye catching Ambience.üê™üê´üê™üê´

Taste is quite different from other places of Hyderabad where we enjoy Biryani. But yes, The Biryani tasted equally good.üòäüòäüòä

For my surprise Veg Biryani is served with French Fries and some patties which tasted good as well.

The place is not soo good. Staff is very arogant and doesnt care abt custor service. Initially they served drinks in plastic glasses and doesnt even have normal glasses to serve drinks. Manager is using abusive language when requested for normal glasses..,0
"Ordered biriyani , chicken butter masala and tandoori rotis... Quantity wise it's good.. taste is nothing extraordinary but yes , can be visited again...",1
"Located in the heart of Financial district it is very convenient place to visit on a weekday with colleagues. Their service was simply superb, they tried to understand the requirement of the customer‚Äôs on each and every table and customized the spice level etc., based on the request. Had good number of options in Veg as well. Over all food was very good, service was exceptional.",2
"Worst experience ever. We were three girls and waiters were rude as much as possible. They even denied to accept orders and it was just our second order.
Never seen such a pub run by rude and unprofessional people.",0
"Here is called another branch of yum yum tree in gachibowli side. Ambience is awesome... we ordered chicken mandi, just amazing... service is little bit slow .. look n view i ll give full marks..",1
Kirak Bole tho kirak Hyderabadi language just loved it had a nice time enjoyed the food mainly pan Kulfi loved iiiittttttttttttttttttttttttttt,2
"It's a pocket friendly but not a customer friendly club. Have been here with my friend and I see the staff was busy with own works rather than offering a menu card. When the same was raised with the manager, he was very arrogant asking us it can't be changed.
The place is a definitely a crowd puller but they should remember that even the best clubs go down the pecking order as the time goes.
Never going to visit this place again.",0
it's not Mandi full,1
"The staffs at BBQ Gachibowli are very good. From start to End they took care ,which dish is good,any modifications needed.
Food was very tasty(starter+Main course)
You can try Fish Finger(chefs special) made on Request.",2
I am a big soup fan and both hot and sour and tomato soup was disappointing. The starter was too paste like in the mouth. The garlic naan was amazing. Daal makhani was below average. They gave us complimentary brownie and ice cream which was average as well. Definitely not a place worth your money.,0
I suggested not to add Cucumber..still they did that. This is not done.,1
"friendly service
The restaurant ambience is good
The food tastes good
And they need to increase the desserts
And jst increase the items
Awesome finally",2
"This review has been long overdue and i have finally managed to get some time out to do so.

So 4 of us visited Mazzo on the 14th of Feb and chose the Veg & Non-Veg options accordingly from their menu, pre-decided. At 2500 INR plus taxes per head we expected the basics, quality service & excellent food.

Imagine our shock when we received exactly the opposite. 

1. The linen on the table we were seated at had cigarette holes in it. 
2. The livery was stained.
3. The restaurant hadn't set up yet even though it was 2130 hrs by the time we arrived.
4. Instead of being given comfortable seating, we were given plastic chairs with white wraps on them.
5. The Cream of Asparagus soup was like toilet water. So was the Avocado Chicken Corn Chowder Soup. They refused to give us extra croutons because we've already eaten too many. What else is one supposed to do when you are served such bad tasting soup?
6. The Bharwab Subz Kebab was dry like dried meat, the Grilled Buffalo Chicken was terrible smelling only - How to eat?, the Lamb Galouti was decent and the Vegetable Lumpia was oily and tiny. - All in All the appetizers were equally useless.
7. Moving onto the Main course now - For the Vegetarian Me, i was given a choice between the Anjeer Kesar Kofte and Spinach & Ricotta Ravioli. I obviously chose the latter D-uh. Big Mistake. When i asked the server why the ravioli was so dry, i was told that the halogen lamp made it so. Then why keep it under the lamp for so long? And the former you ask, it was so sweet, it was like drinking Chaasni - the sugar water from the Rasgulla or Gulab Jamun dabba.
8. Not like the Non-Vegetarians had it any better. 6 Hours Braised Lamb Shank OR Nalli Nihari OR Murgh Methi. 
Lamb - It was more bones than lamb and also, baby lamb Such a tiny piece that my husband had to eat another dinner after we got home.
Nalli Nihari - More like Nal ka Paani. No taste no Nihari.
Murgh Methi - WhyWhyWhy so many bones in a dosh which one assumes is boneless and that too in a 5 star hotel. Roti you ask? - Please DO NOT.
9. And last but not the least, Dessert.
Vanilla Bean Pannacotta - I make better Pannacotta and i just wanted to cry. The coulis was just sugar water with some red colouring.
Kesar Malai Kulfi - This was bought from Scoops. The server told us also. The only thing on the menu that tasted fantastic. Ate 4 and went home.",0
food was delivered cold,1
"Been many times here and the place is not crouded during dinner time, the best time to visit this place is during dinner time only as lunch time too much crouded with office guys specially Mon to Fri, coming to food , prawns and fish starters are too too good , other kebabs also too good, staff is too good in service and they treat us like kings and queens, I strongly recommend Gachibowli branch as less crowded during dinner and weekens",2
"Ambience wise it's the best rooftop place one could possibly ask for. The behaviour of staff however is highly disappointing. They have this bad attitude as though you're blessed to be dining there, now that certainly isn't accomodating, is it ? In fact, it ruined the entire experience despite the place being amazing and food being great. I guess it really is important to keep tabs on whom you're hiring.",0
don't change your our minds,1
"The taste of increase when its BBQ,its taste doubled when is comes to Barbeque Nation ..Service is more jet sped..food was excellent..need little improvement in ambiance",2
"As the name suggests, its supposed to be a Marriott and that's what you expect. The reality is very different.

Let's start with my experience even before reaching. I was advised to make a reservation for 2 people almost 3 days ahead to get a good place by the pool. And so I did.
I was denied reservation saying that it's really ""full"" but they finally said they can get me one table. I was happy.

It has a separate entrance in SLN terminus with it's own parking and valet which is real comfortable.
Now let's talk real business.

Upon Reaching I see the place completely empty. Maybe 2 tables were taken and rest were empty. I didn't understand why they had to do play so hard to get. Even by the time we left, the place was hardly even half full. The whole inside area was empty and few tables taken outside.

Ambience : the only thing good about it is the ambience but its not as grand as people suggest. It's very mediocre.

Staff: THE WORST SERVICE EVER. I have had better service in small restaurants or even small Dhabas if I may compare them. I had to call waiting staff for 10 mins for everything and they took their happy time to come. There is an inside seating and outside, we took the inside because it was too noisy out.

I asked one waiter why the service was so bad and he very rudely replied to me ""Andar koi nahi baithta"" (No one sits inside)
If you didnt have plans to serve people inside then why did you keep the damm place open?

There was a buffet and we went for it, now they kept a live counter open in the buffet with no chef there. We had to again wait for the waiting staff to notice us calling them, they then had to go call the chef who again took his jolly time to come and prepare what he was supposed to.

Being a Marriott, you'd expect some decent service they said if I'm paying with card I have to come to the billing counter and pay there. Such behaviour does not warrant prices at par with any 5 star hotel.

Food: There was hair in the food. Starters were okay but main course was very bad. And let me make special note of the dessert.

If I'm coming for a buffet in such a place, I'd expect to have desserts made by them and not bought from the local sweet shop. They bought kaaju kathli, Rasgulla, Some barfi among some cake etc. And no spoons to take them, had to again wait for staff to come give us spoons to take some dessert.

Next to the dessert counter there were dirty clothes kept in plain view. I've attached pictures

After paying when we were leaving someone tried to come and ask us how our evening went. When we tried to Express our grief, that waiter/manager just blatantly shut me off. I'm not paying for you to shut me off when you asked me how it was in the first place.

It was the most disappointing experience I ever had in Hyderabad. Marriott has to get its game straight and take some serious action in this property. I will for sure NEVER come here again and will also not let my friends waste their money here.",0
"Just make sure why you are going there. If food it would be a 3 rating(yes comparatively cheaper buffet in near by restaurants though) and if it drinks it would hang near 4. Their varieties in drinks get that for them.
Place is good in ambiance but total inside so not a roof top or garden. You can enjoy the game days well than other days
And yes a good value for your money",1
"Waiters butter customers more than the kebabs üòÇ, jokes apart the service is too good and they do have a decent range of items, eventhough they lack in terms of number of items but it's compensated with the quality level. The place feels a bit cramped up bt got a good vibe to it. Definitely would visit again.",2
"It‚Äôs true that ambiance is good, but the staff has failed to direct me to the restaurant. Though I requested to book a poolside table they didn‚Äôt reserve, only the buffet people will have access to it, it seems. Food was good. But the staff was not professional enough.",0
The place was pretty crowded for a weekday. We ordered a couple of chicken items. I only remember the food to be extra spicy. The brews of this place are good though,1
"Awesome place, Awesome food, lovely staff (Azaad Hussain) was tremendous at his work one of the most polite guy I ever see in any restaurant",2
"The only reason this place gets a two is because they‚Äôve got the best ambiance and the food in brunches is very very good. But trust me, they have to change their attitude towards the customers. We were 6 people went there by making a prior reservation for brunch and to continue till late evening after brunch. The reservation was confirmed, and it was all good until the brunch was over. We wanted to continue after brunch to dinner and we agreed to pay whatever we consume after the brunch hours. An hour later a guy comes and tells us to leave because they‚Äôve reservations. I informed him that we made a reservation too but they denied to let us continue. However, we all agreed to leave and asked for bill. Here is the twist, the bill comes 30 mins later and there was no one to collect cash/card from us. They made us wait for more than 1.5 hours and all this while, no table was occupied. It was all EMPTY! I went to the manager and asked him if he can help us checkout, and confronted about the reservations. The manager now tells me to continue till dinner. I did not understand the issue they had and never bothered to ask too. We all left and agreed to never go back there again.",0
"Food-(3.5/5) There are very limited items to order, especially in main course, there was only butter chicken. The mocktails were also just okay.

Service-(4/5) They were good, they knew their job well.

Ambience-(3.5/5) It was good, could have been more eye catchy, but it was okay. The singer sang very good songs, had the mood up",1
This place is good when you come empty stomach... Just kidding . Barbeque Nation have been always my favorite when it comes to barbeque and their amazing mocktails and juices as they keep innovating the menu and the deserts. Has a lag in my order when I had been there last time but I guess it may be because of the high intensity of people who come and dine. A very good place with very welcoming staff.,2
"Ambiance is good..
Servers are courteous..
#FOOD is COLD & INEIDBLE ..QUALITY IS NOT GOOD and PATHETIC..
Walk in for drinks and the ambience, KINDLY FIND ANOTHER PLACE FOR FOOD if your really hungry..",0
"Straight to the point, the food is really good. I‚Äôve been there around 10 o‚Äô clock in the night, maybe because of that the food which was served was cold and that pretty much disappointed me! :|
Anyways, this is a nice place to hangout with friends or family. It has a big screen of a match going on with light music and serves wine too.",1
Went yesterday to bbq. Wonderful service. Special thanks to Roy who took care of us.he kept checking if everything was fine or need to customize anything. Food was yummy. Became a big fan of bbq. Good going guys!!!!,2
"Wow!! This place doesn't serve alcohol after 10:30 pm. I didn't see that mentioned anywhere. Their contact numbers are not reachable.
Pathetic experience",0
"My exp with the place was a bit different from many other reviews. Went for a lunch with wifey. The place seemed more suitable for groups, college kids and so on.
The food was decent though. Not much to complain about. Service was satisfactory, while waiters were prompt, it wasn't a refined experience.
Overall, I would like to give 3.5/5,but unfortunately can't on the slider scale.
Food - 4/5
Service 3.5/5
Decor/ambirnce - 3/5",1
"Early Christmas celebrations. we were dressed up and wanted fine dine. We were told that Barbeque Nation is always booked, we tried our luck anyway and got a table for 9:30.
From the greeting to serving and the host was so nice...I must give them 5 stars for excellent customer service.
The Starters were amazing....I love prawns but it's kinda tricky to get perfect and well seasoned 
But their Prawns are the best grilled prawns I ever tasted. They could have done a little better job for tandoori chicken but it was fine ..... the starters were so yumm that we didn't want to try the main course.... My personal favs were Grilled Prawns and RoseMary Chicken...mmm..  mmm... mmmmm yummy !!!! 

Thank you so much for your excellent service and Great Food..Hope to visit you guys soon..!!!",2
I had great respect for marriott hotel but i lost everythig when i went their in my special day valentines day! It was the most horrible experience !! The service is very bad and they were harsh with the customers ! I dint expect this from marriott hotel i dint think i will ever goto marriott again!!!,0
"Only 3 stars for taste of food. So visited here with colleagues for lunch.
Have expected a good ambeince but too crowded and service was at its lowest,
Might be only cause of Friday.
But Food was good.
And Little conjested place.",1
"We have been having a grand time whenever we visit Barbeque Nation Gachiwoli.. Be it the food, the ambience and the hospitality of the staffs, this place is a must visit.. the staffs here treat you as a part of family and serve you till you get the utmost satisfaction on the taste and quantity of the food.
I would specially like to mention about Mr Naresh from BBQ nation Gachiwoli. The way he treats and welcomes you will make you visit this place all over again and again.. He takes care of you from giving you the best seats available to the best of the food you can have. I give him and this place 5 bright stars..",2
Ordered food online. Horrible food. Full of spices and oil even after giving specific instructions not to make it spicy. Rotis were raw. Won‚Äôt recommend to anyone.,0
"A chick place.

Went for a team lunch. Service was very good with staff being courteous and prompt in serving food.

We opted for buffet which has decent number of options for both Vegetarian and Non-vegeterians.

An ideal place to hangout with friends on a game night enjoying the drinks and food.",1
"Food: 4.5

Service : the staff were all very polite but a bit slow

The taste of food was very good. They had chicken tandoori, mutton kebab, veg kebab, American corn, creamy crispy potato as starters apart from the grilled stuff. On the grill they served one variety each of chicken, basa fish, prawn, mushroom, paneer, pineapple. The main course did not have much variety but honestly no one had enough space for it. The dessert options were sorted and tasty. They had 2 ice cream flavours, Gulab jamun, kheer, brownie, milk cakes, pastries and tarts, 2 kulfi. Over all the experience was very good.

Would want to visit againüòä",2
The restaurant did not feel hygienic at all. There were house flies all over. The tables were wiped but felt really old and unclean. Couldn't order or taste anything to write a neat review for the so said reasons.,0
I really don't like the place much . The prices were too high . Small area . Just don't like that much. The music was not upto the mark . And the place was dull,1
Been here with friends on a weekday for dinner and this place never fails to meet expectations...be it any outlet. The food is great...the staff was friendly. Only one negative with this outlet is space...it is extremely congested...the tables are too closely placed...hardly any proper aisle space for guests to walk!,2
"I am waiting for 25 mint. Staff this is eignor i tollk to not care. I am regular customer

Last bling time very very pathetic experience. Customers we have don't talk me. We have respect for guests. You have caser not respected. I am customer..plz plz plz manager be careful to the caser we not have respected hin very pathetic bave. I am regular customer. Last and fast",0
"Landed in this small bar for new year lunch buffet. They had limited items in their spread but each of them were super yummy. Nothing to complain about as this costed us merely 400bucks per head.
For drinks, I would totally recommend Project 51 cocktail (A must try!)
The only downside was service. The waiters were friendly but extremely idle and we had a waiting period of atleast 10mins between the serves. Many of the items were only served after repeated calls.",1
"Great staff always ready to serve with smile, celebrated our anniversary over there got exceptional service by Ravi, Kumud and Chef. Always take care of our spice level... Love to visit again and again........",2
"worst food served by Green Bawarchi  i ever had in my life. it seems they packed stale food. quality was very bad. Thank God that food was not for guest. i will advise you all that please do not order food from green bawarchi.
we had ordered butter naa,n romali roti,shahi paneer qorma, chilli chicke and handi chiken biryani. no one was eatable except roti",0
"Catchy restaurant name and very good ambiance. As this place is mainly a bar, it is not sensible to comment on the food. The spread of the buffet was limited and the taste was good. Pricing is also decent.",1
"Very much satisfied with the food and service. They had customised kulfi with different types of toppings and it's really good. The non-veg starters are served with normal spice levels and are tasty. If you like spicy food, ask for Tandoori chicken with extra spices. You will love it.",2
Green Bawarchi restaurant actually many times visit only for launch. Date 23-03-19 tomorrow same time visit. Speacilly my favorite dishes chicken biriyani & mutton biriyani. I order one hundi mutton biriyani. But I am very discpointed for this biriyani rice not good. And mutton raw. After few minutes order mutton curry & zera rice. Same discpointed. For food not good. And taste bellow poor,0
"They claim to be a European bar who serves continental cuisine.
Went here with my pals.
We ordered Peri
- Peri Chicken pizza and Assorted Pizza.

Service: The waiters were courteous and gave a good suggestion on what to order and helped while splitting the bill as well.
The service wasn‚Äôt the quickest with around 6-8 people in the house.
Good parking available here.

Food: The pizzas were pretty mediocre. I liked the cheese quality and the toppings were in generous amount. We asked for a medium crust and the crust was a bit stiff.
Peri peri chicken was pretty good as the flavor was indulging.
The pizzas were missing the wow factor and wasn‚Äôt really specially.
My friends ordered pastas and wings.
Wings were pretty good and the pastas were less in quantity and wasn‚Äôt too good.

Ambience: It has dim low light and calm ambience with a street view and a music üéµ. Really liked the ambience and the decor as well. The tables were typically made out of moulded tin and gave a different feel and look.

Worth a shot with Zomato Gold

Final Verdict:
Food: 3/5
Ambience: 5/5
Service: 4/5
Hygiene: 4/5",1
Had been there twice. Everytime had a wonderfyl experience. Good ambience and very friendly staffs. The chef himself turn to us asking for any special items to be ordered. Great service.,2
"Chicken not cooked properly. Rice does not taste good, no spice at all. Food was not hot even though it was delivered within 30 minutes time. Not recommended at all",0
"Visited this place for an office party that was organised. Pretty good place considering very compact space and seating. The smoking area is way too small.

The food is not that great but quite delicious , nothing I can come.plain off, egg munchuria was standout off all the dishes we ordered.

Overall a one-time visit place , lacks repeat value just because it is way too small",1
"Food:
I had the Non Veg buffet.I loved the starters and the desserts.I personally like their Kulfies the most.

Everything else:
I have been to this branch twice. Service is really good.I had a great experience. Its the best barbeque restaurant I have been to.

Will I go again? Definitely!",2
I visited with my friends for dinner . It was a fake experience. Becos the sttaf behavior was like unprofession n rude .they don't know how to speak with the customer. No sense no manners nothing.,0
"I have only one word.... mediocre.... We went there thinking it would have good music and nice decor but it had neither. Since we were not drinking, the menu also seemed very limited. Go there if you wanna drink n snack, but then there are cheaper places which offer both with a better ambience.",1
"The best restaurant we have been to, till date.
Awesome food and great service. The hospitality shown at the restaurant each and every time that we have visited is at the peaks compared to other restaurants. we treat this restaurant as a family restaurant and make sure we visit this once a month. Never disappointed us in any aspect..
not even once..",2
Very pathetic. Found two insects in the biryani. How one can eat such an unhealthy food. This is really unfortunate but they should also care about these things. I will not ever try again.,0
"Food and ambiance was good. The drawback was the service. We ordered Saucy Chestnut and they took almost an hour to serve it. Each time we asked the manager he said it will be served in 5 minutes. There was also a spider on our table, thankfully after we finished our food. Informed the manager again. He Couldn‚Äôt care less.",1
"For ravi , he is friendly. Politely answering to questions. Good in taste yeah it's very good everything is fine and the kulfi you don't believe me",2
not good,0
"Went with our colleagues last week and had a good lunch over there. Coming to ambience it is quite dark with sufficient light . Am quite impressed with the furniture with minimalistic design.
Food which didn‚Äôt impressed me much . Options are less. Pasta is terrific . Miloxktails are the best among all. They had their own flavours which is not copied somewhere .",1
Extremely courteous staff & great service...Special mention to Kumud Barman for his exemplary service...keep up the good work guys üëç..Good job,2
I ordered for a egg biryani this is what I found on that .if I want to have a egg biryani I could have ordered the same...not expected from this restaurant...,0
"I would rate ambience hardly at three and doesn't look like the pics on Zomato. The place was smelly and even the AC wasn't working well. 
Beers with fancy names and glasses was an attraction but that was the only point of attraction and the taste was a big let down. They don't have an in-house brewery but beers are imported as they claim and very costly too. In comparison to it, there are a lot of places to try in-house brewed beers like OTM brewery etc.
Even their food menu is so limited and we tried their chicken pizza and it was one of the worst tasting pizza I had in a long time, just chicken pieces and no other topping at all at 450 Bucks. Similar experience with fish and chips, the batter was running away from the fish and it was over fried and was more or less feels like eating chips then fish.
Really a disappointing experience and more disappointing as I went with high hopes. I don't recommend this to anyone because it's not even cheap to recommend to those who don't want to spend much.",1
Nice place very good food but main course should be be improved because starters 4 dessert 4 and main course 3.5 because food in main course was not upto mark need some taste build up,2
"Taste is wrost , even rice in biryani is bad, what to write comment for you guys.

Please don't go
And please don't order online
Good for nothing",0
"It is located in the heart of Gachibowli but the service was not as expected, delay service and then the food was not that good. The ambience was good though, they need to improve their service as well as the food . I hope the management will look into the above points so that the next time we plan to visit we get a good food and service.",1
"5 star standard . Specially mentioning RM Mr. Bivison and staff Mr. Gopal.. we were welcomed, served and treated with high standard quality. Also, the chef Basudev make sure that our prefrance is fulfilled.
Thank you Bivison and for taking care.",2
"Quantity is very less, from the last two months i have given 3 big orders at that time both quality and quantity is good based on that i have order today again, but now it is disappointed. I am not going to order again",0
"Ambience - 4/5
Food - 4/5
Drink - 3/5
The drinks i felt are overpriced but the ambience is good.
The staff is friendly and the food served is delicious.
The Mexican pizza was delicious.",1
"Excellent place.
Taste of food is good. Spread is good. Value for money.
Service is excellent.
If you wish to go for a barbeque, this is the best place in hyd.",2
Biryani was good taste but the Motton PCs were less mostly bone. May be next time get better..chicken tandoori was excellent and can order again,0
"Went for buffet, too much spices on the barbecues, after certain point your stomach burns. Not a great main course spread, no variety. The dessert looked promising but it let me down big time. The Apple cake was not baked properly, the pudding was thick. The restaurant promised a lot but delivered very little. Only thing I liked is the staffs, they are very hospitable.",1
"Have visited this place on 2nd October with my family to celebrate my sister's birthday. All the places were booked but luckily got seats in late hour for lunch. Place is not that huge but very well maintained, hospitality is top notch by their staff.

Coming to food, starters were served as well as barbeque was set up on our table. Chicken, prawns, mushroom, paneer and seekh kebab all were marinated very nicely. It was really amazing in taste. Potato prepared with mustard sauce was just wow. There was no dish which didnt disappoint.

Main course - This is the part where they have exceeded and crossed all the expectations. All the dishes were really good in taste, usually I skip main course and go for dessert after starters bit here I have tried and it was really good. Egg curry, chicken, mutton Rogan all were good. Biryani was also good. Noodles with sauce were delicious enough. It wasn't their just to keep up the numbers.

Dessert - My favorite part and completely satisfied my sweettooth. Pastries, please cake, kheer, brownie all were good. Kulfi was nice which was served with little bit of rabdi on the top.

Overall we had a ball at this place, from starter to main course and dessert all were really good. They didn't give us any point where anything can be deducted. Service was top notch as usual and value for money. This outlet is one the best on in Hyderabad hands down.",2
I ordered fish biryani. But the restaurant delivered me prawns biryani. And biryani taste is not good. Better choose other restaurants than this.,0
Went with high expectations as it was BY mothi mahal with a concept like AB‚Äôs and barbecue nation... must say the food was not up to the mark!!! The service was exceptional and good ambience but not the food.... spread was decent.... hopefully they will improve,1
"We went to this place on Wednesday for Dinner. It was difficult to find a table and had to wait for 30 minutes. The ambience of the place is average and its a small place however the starters were really good (Crispy Corn, Panner Tikka, Mushroom and Fruit BBQ). Coming to the main course, it was average but the desserts were really good especially Gulab Jamun, Rabadi and Kulfi.",2
Not bad,0
Great ambience to start with. Taste and quality good. The only concern is that the variety is less. Service is decent. Surender our steward for the lunch was very patient and helpful.,1
"Really These BarbeQue Nation's outlet is so friendly....i never seen before....we went there last night, total number were 40+...lots of kids were in my gang....they are playing a lot....they are means staffs of Barbeque Nation, always looking smile....now, foods are just too good...Kuch kehene ki baat i nehi hain",2
Paneer tikka masala was all gravy with just 4 pieces of paneer.,0
"Food= Taste and variety of food items=3/5
Ambience = Look and Feel=3/5
Service= Timely service and Cleanliness=2.5/5
Pocket= Quantity vs Price =5/5
Value= Quality=4/5

When it comes to spread of items, they were just too many. Barbeque items, main course as well as desserts. The taste was however was not to the level of satisfaction. Ambience was just average.

Service definitely needs a heavy improvement. We went on a non rush day, serving of barbeque items were over flowing in the first and single service. There is no concept of coming to the table second time. No one really really bothered the table. Even after requesting so many times, servers really didn't bother much to serve breads in the table or refilling any barbeque items. We just had to go with the main course to continue our lunch. Mutton Curry and biryani were extra ordinary. Jalebi served in desserts was too good",1
"We had a fantastic time and loved the service and food both. The serving personnel made extra sure of comfort for the kids, kudos to Azaad and team.",2
"Taste less food,not well perpred & egg shell had mixed in food so please check once while preparing and quality is also not nice ,this is the reason",0
This restro is located in Gachibowli in The Platina building. We headed to this place for dinner with team on Friday evening...The place is good ambience wise and the stuff are friendly too..The service was quick and they do ask you the reviews and suggestions..Now coming to the food it was okay but as compared to other buffet kitchens like ABs or Barbeque Nation they still lag behind with the same price..The starters were good in taste but the main course and dessert was ok ok..,1
"This place goes and keeps up with the name! Amazing starters. The chicken kebabs are wonderful. The crispy corn and the Cajun spice potatoes are super duper awesome!! After the rounds of starters,. There wasn't any space for the main course so directly went for desserts. Their in house kulfis are the speciality here. Paan kulfi tastes the best! Gulab jamuns with ice-cream make the perfect combo.",2
very late,0
"This is my second visit to this place. Like the Ambience much and cool place to chill out. Had been there along with a friend for dinner. We didn't want to go for Buffet for sure, so it was ala carte.

Angara Murgu Kabab, Rara Ghost and Butter Naan... Starter was with much salt and lemon... Rara Ghost is nice, perfection at it's best... Was a good combination with Butter Naan...

Service was very nice and as I said earlier nice ambience...",1
"Awesome food and awesome Service.Specially by Mr. Gopal who was awesome with his services .
Keep it up and Thumbs up for Barbeque nation , Gachibowli.
My birthday went awesome",2
worst I ever had .,0
"Visited Urban Asia based on their rating and reviews. However, we were utterly disappointed. We visited the Gachibowli location of the restaurant and it is clubbed with East India Co. The waiter handed us the ""Signature"" menu and that is when the ordeal began. Most of the signature dishes were unavailable. It was surprising since it was a Saturday and I assumed that the restaurant would be well prepared to handle something important as their Signature Menu. Eventually, we had to settle for the buffet which was priced at 650++. Overall a disappointing evening.",1
"Awesome place !!!

1. Good ambiance,
2. Great food ( Veg)
3. Chef always comes to your table to know if we are enjoying the starters and any improvement is needed or any special starter that we prefer etc.,


My kid loves this place and we have been there multiple times and still don't get bored.",2
Worse. They deliver wrong items and less quantity for orders. No one from restaurant responded to call. Zomato also tried to reach but still no response,0
We have been there for team dinner for a buffet. Ambience is good. Food is decent but serving is not at all good. You can neglect this as we have lot of options aroubd Gachibowli,1
"And of course the best place to celebrate your special occasions. Beautiful place to dine with your friends and family. Perfect ambiance. Delicious food. A sweet gesture of cake from the restaurant itself and song by the staff, making it more special. And the varieties of kulfis.",2
not so good,0
"Food - 4
Service - 3

The food is nice but the fancy dishes fail to impress. Had ordered Lotus leaf fried rice - but that neither had any distinguishing flavor of lotus leaf nor a hint of chili oil, but what lets you down is the service - Too SLOW.

And they also goofed up on the Zomato 1+1 food offer. They later corrected it, but not before arguing.

Will I go here again - YES, but not the Gachibowli joint. The other Urban Asia at Jubilee hills is a way better!",1
"Good service, very good receiving nature.
Very well satisfied with his service and the food.
Outstanding service by azad hussain with good responsibility towards customers.",2
"I ordered Mutton Biryani online but was very dissappointed with the qualtiy of the biryani, mutton was full of bones and undigestable.  also it was very spicy and really wasn't good for a Sunday dinner. Will never order again from there...:-(",0
"Sushi was bad,
Starters were okay ,
I don't understand why there waso muglai / Indian food and not Asian food in an restraunt which specialises in Asian cuisine.",1
"Loved the food, ambience is good, deserts could be somewhat better but overall i would recommend this place. Staff is friendly. Chicken is the best of all the dishes they serve.",2
"Pathetic service, stale food( especially mutton), starters are not well cooked either, grilled chicken and chicken biryani were somewhat edible compared to rest of the menu.",0
"Dissatisfaction and Disappointment!

Urban Asia Gachibowli !
I am here for a lunch buffet but alas, wasnt what I was expecting. Starters Pathetic !
The prawn is okaish, apart from that everything stands to be a disaster. Uncooked Chicken Malai kababs to kabab mei "" huddi"" (bone).
Beware of the dirty, stinky and glue piece of cloth napkin!!

Soup served was a shorba which tasted masala warm water. The mocktail tasted really good. Finally !!

Coming to the main course I am not putting up any pictures as they were average ! Trust me nothing special !!

The chat counter was good. U can try that. From Chole kulche to Bhel puri. 4 items.

Deserts: limited but were good.

Ice Cream: They were making it on a ice tray however some local base brand.

Overall
Food 3/5
Service 1/5
Value for Money 2.5/5

Recomended only if you can grab the buffet in a deal.
Like 50% of an all.",1
"I visited this branch for Independence Day lunch with two of my friends. As usual Barbecue Nation was superb at its food and service. People in Hyderabad prefer AB‚Äôs over BN, but somehow I felt BN is still a better place. Staff members were really good and everything was so delicious! We really enjoyed our time there. Thumbs up üëç",2
Worst food,0
"Good food. Recommend the garlic fried rice and fried ice cream. The veg dimsums are also very good. The only problem is the service, it's a bit slow.",1
It's always good to visit this place. We celebrate some of our most precious days. Good quality and service is excellent. I wish you keep this quality always.,2
bad,0
"The lamb dish was good, but the pork was undercooked. Better avoid pork here. Coz that could be dangerous. The ambience is good. The decor is warm with heritage wooden doors, pillars n other elements from old Rajasthan havelis.",1
Service was excellent and staffs were much polite. Frequent visits by chef to make sure taste is acceptable was laudable but after a point it had bit vexed us. Ambiance was good but space was very less hence during weekends it sounds like bring in a market.,2
worst food actually I ordered chicken chilly gravy but he sent chicken manchuria and people don't prefer this restaurant.,0
"First visit

1. Garlic Fried rice - good
2. Mixed veggies in schezwan sauce - good
3. Mixed mushroom platter - did not please my taste buds. Left half the dish. I am not a fan of any mushroom other than the button mushroom. Even if I liked other mushrooms, I wouldn't have liked this dish. It's nothing special. Tasted like simple sauted mushrooms.
4. Showstopper - Yin Yan soup. Half of it was a thick corn soup which has a subtle sweet taste. The other half of it had thick coriander soup. I think this is what they serve full bowl as lemon coriander soup. Fan of this. Coming back for this soup.",1
Food is excellent.......ambience is very good......loved the Greek festival......Azad Hussian gave us a very good service......overall experience is excellent.....,2
DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE. THEY SERVE TASTELESS RAW CHICKEN WITH NO REMORSE AND NO REACTION. WORST RESTAURANT OF GACHIBOWLI!! NO ACTION,0
"Great food. Esp the Know Suey. Starters were good as well. Service by the attendants was poor. Delayed orders after multiple follow ups. Great ambience. Mild music. Mild air conditioning. Very clean. Definitely try the fried prawns as part of the starters. Wasabi needs to be more like the real wasabi. They need to serve the sushi along with the wasabi and soy sauce provided in small bowls - the bowls we're missing. And you had to ask for the wasabi as well. Should be part of the table sauces, etc. Good to go there once in a while.",1
"Amazing food and ambience.
Starters were simply delicious.
Desserts were also really good.
Would definitely recommend everyone to visit this place.",2
DISGUSTING!! DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT EVER AGAIN. THEY SERVED RAW CHICKEN. I ORDERED FULL GRILL CHICKEN AND COULDN'T EVEN EAT ONE BITE. THE WHOLE CHICKEN WAS RAW!! THEY SHOULD BE SUED IN CONSUMER FORUM!!,0
"We opted for alakarte here. But the took a round of the food variety for buffet, it was pretty good. But the dessert section didn't interest me much.

The buffet had dumplings, sushi, which I felt were food for buffet.

We we in mood to eat proper Chinese. We ordered a pork dimsum, stir fried chicken starter.
Another chicken main course and fried rice.

Everything was good.

But then comes the bill part.

I Really don't know how they missed the Zomato 1+1 to cut from the bill.
Also they had so 91 bucks extra S. Tax apart from GST.
Which made us change the bill again.

Honestly speaking, after serving good food, missing the gold and adding extra money apart from GST decreases the moral value for the place.

Kindly try avoiding the addition of that.

Rest food is good.
Service if good.
Can come back again for another turn of Chinese.!!",1
"Unlimited BBQ food with delicious desserts-
Ambiance-
Barbeque Nation is located near Wipro Lake exactly beside Deli 9 Bistro. This outlet of Barbeque Nation is quite congested. As it is situated at the Ground floor, indoor sitting includes well maintained sitting arrangement with large tables of capacity upto 8-10 people per table. They play silent English songs in the background.
Food-
As we have arrived before 7pm, we got the privilege of the early bird complimentary mocktails. They served veg kebab and american corn before starting the barbeque. As we were six members they brought 2 barbeques. In the barbeque they served all types of non vegetarian and vegetarian food including prawns, chicken, fish mutton, paneer, potatoes, corns. We had lots of prawns and fish in the starter and had for at least 2 hours. After that, we moved towards the soup, they have only one non veg and one veg soup. We requested for hot and sour soup, so they prepared for us. In main course they served veg as well as non veg curries, Chinese and biryani. Finally they had a large variety of desserts in their menu including kulfis, ice creams, Gulab Jamun, pastries, firni and brownies.
Service-
Service was very quick and the staff was very good. Chef himself came to our table to take the feedback.",2
"There is lot of discrimination between zomato gold customers and regular customers.

They give lot less quantity for zomato gold customers and also desriminated behaviour.",0
"Ambience decent , parking to the place is an issue . Tom yum soup good , paneer tikka ok , lotus stem ok . Service average, steward Sk was not upto the mark , he looked totally off mood . Chilli garlic noodles was outstanding, manchow fried rice was delicious",1
The service is too good.. If you are not satisfied with any food item basudev will recook as per your wish and serves it again... The service is just excellent compared to other outlets..,2
"Only one word to describe simply ""Not upto the mark"". they will say 3 non veg starters but they will provide only 2 . Food and customer service could be better.",0
Visited Urban Asia two times and had moderate experience. Food taste is pretty but service is very very slow. Staff took more than 20 min to serve the food initially and reordering was like endless waiting. Buffet services seems better than ala carte.,1
Food was tasty. Staffs were very friendly. Although the options in main course as well as for starters was a bit less and service was relatively slow when compared to other barbeques. Still would recommend to visit once.,2
"Went with team for lunch over there...first proper parking is not there....resto is quiet small with very limited options in veg and non veg.... ambience, starters, veg non veg main course everything is just avg... everything is just dull and avg...I mean neither food is spicy or tasty ...it just avg and dull...",0
"This restaurant space in Gachibowi is the fusion of Urban Asia and Eat India Company which are under the same roof with different names.

‚úìAmbience

This is very much spacious having multiple separated halls for group dining with cozy ambience. This restaurant is themed with village style vintage wooden decors all-around the place. Most of the interior walls are covered with vintage wooden doors, windows and locks.

And also there is a separate dining hall where one of the wall is completely covered with photo frames of old nizami Kings and their belongings.

‚úìFood

We went here for a dinner buffet. The food is really delicious and this was the first time I was liking Sea food in the starters. All the starters are really good but Kung Pao fish and Prawns parsely dry are the best of its kind.

Dinner Buffer Menu:

*Starters:

1. Murgh Haryali Tikka
2. Lahsooni Murgh Tikka
3. Kung Pao Fish
4. Prawns Parsely dry
5. Crispy Potato Corn cube
6. Sichuan Baby Corn
7. Paneer Angar Tikka
8. Corn Tikka
9. French fries

*Main Course:

2. Yellow Dal Tadka
3. Palak Paneer
4. Murgh Lababdar
5. Mutton do Pyaza
6. Murgh Dum biryani
7. Sabzi Dum biryani
8. Garlic noodles
9. Butter Naan and Roti
10. Curd Rice

We don't have much variety in desserts but the ice creams here are really good and served with different luscious toppings. Just looking at them will trigger the cravings in your mouth.

‚úìService

The only saddest part of this restaurant is the service that they provide. Though it is a buffet, All the starters will served to the table. There is a lot much interval from one starter to the other starter that they serve.

And you will feel that half the time your plate is empty and you need to keep on waiting for them to serve. The service part of this restaurant is really irritating and this needs to be corrected with much importance.

‚úìValue for money

The dinner buffet here costs around Rs.650/- per person. And you will definitely feel that this place is worth your money. Be prepared to bear with the bad service and rest you will definitely enjoy. Have a great dining and good dayüòä",1
"I went there with my parents, and it was totally worth it. The service was extremely good and my parents loved every bit of it.
Starters and dessert always amazing.
Main course have a lot of varities but we always fill ourselves with starters that no place is left in stomach to try main course.
Overall it has been one of my favourite place .",2
not good. chicken pieces are fully roasted. Disappointed. Not a good taste.,0
I usually visit to this place for dining after office the variety of dishes served are good and are also tried to be kept in much authentic way .... It's quite expensive as compared to other restaurants in same service...,1
Qutub Yasin - It was really an awesome experience with these guys. He was really friendly and we had a very good conversation him. I will come back hungry for more.,2
"Below average restaurant,food is not that good,most people go there for buffet,they served cheap welcome drink,which infected my throat.Thats",0
"I went to this restro yesterday for dinner with my husband to beat the monsoon dullness. This outlet is in Gachibowli Rd above Ratnadeep store. There are couple of other restros and to be precise its on the 4th floor.
It was little surprising as this restro share the common space with Eat India Company.
We did not have any prior booking but was amused as there were scarcely couple of diners in the weekend !
One of the staff directed us to a crampy place and we outrightly rejected his proposal. The staff was rigid and told that the place where we wanted to sit with a nice view was already reserved !

We were also curt and told them that if we dont sit in a comfy area, we have other choices.Reluctantly they agreed but I was surprised that hardly two or three diners came while we were having dinner !
They could have attended our request in the first go for the feel good quotient.

Anyways let me quickly summarize the orders we made there-

1. Crabmeat Soup- This soup was thick with minced crab meat. The broth was bland and you can customise it by infusing soy sauce, vineager and crushed pepper. The whiff of craby flavor will surely tingle your taste buds.
2. Corn Cubes - A must try out platter. The dish was innovative. The american corn flour was mixed with miniscule chopped vegetables. Then the kneaded flour was frozen in small cubes and were golden fried. It was crisp and at the same time had a jelly consistency.
3. Chicken Yakitori- I did not like this preparation. It was very dull and tasteless. There were six skewered chicken sticks with capscicum and onion. The chicken pieces were succulent but did not imbue any flavor.

Main Course -

1. Manchow Chicken Fried Rice - The rice was flavorful and spicy with lots of veggies and diced chicken pieces in it. It was a bit sticky and can be consumed at its own.

Dessert
1. Bangkok Custurd- I was assuming that this dessert will be cold but it was just the opposite. The custurd was hot and thick and made with coconut puree. The thick sauce was decadent with loads of nuts ! It tasted like Firni. As accompaniment there were thin crusty pineapple spring rolls. It was just yum for the greedy tongue.

Total- Rs. 1396 ( Inclusive of taxes )

Cobclusion - The price range is moderate and the portion is generous in amount.The food is delectable but did not have any exlusive or signature dish which can attract guest for the next time.

The staffs are inexperienced and do not have knowledge abot the items put in the menu card. No coordination among the staffs. Either different staffs will come and ask for the same course of order for multiple times or no one will attend the guest.

The dessert section in the menu card is quite attractive but most of the items are not available. I had a discussion on this with the manager but rather than taking it as a constructive feedback he delved himself into arguments !

This is not the place to enjoy your special occassions. Its just okayish for casual dinner/ lunch. I will think twice to visit this place again.",1
"Barbeque Nation absolutly Great place to Dine with frinds r family..
Buffet was simply mouth watering food..
Ambince superb
Service great ..
Great exprince we had..
We want to visit again .......",2
"I had taken Dinner Buffet. The ambience was good. The food taste and dishes were below average. Everything was self service even the starter. For Veggie people's, I would recommend not to go this restaurant as they don't have items in Paneer and Mushroom in Veg. Apart from this, they had dishes like Egg Burji, Egg Curry, rajma masala, plain rice(not even fried rice), Bhendi fry, etc. Such dishes gave me a feeling that I am dining in a roadside dhaba/tapri. Coconut Barfi, Ice cream was not at all special and seemed to be of low quality, The Pastries tasted as if they are preserved since many days. Overall I would say the buffet is a waste of money in this restaurant.",0
"Ambience : Great, perfectly lit and has separate section for smokers.
Food : starters are really good (did not have much variety but were good in taste) , the main course and desert were just like any average buffet. I would say it does have value for money, not that expensive.
Overall : visit if you have tried all the other buffet restaurants and want to to try something new",1
"Went for lunch along with wife and bro for birthday lunch, And Lunch was perfect and had some decent items on menu, Gopal took good care of us. I would recommend this place for great lunch.",2
"damn too much oil, I can make another curry out of it, that much",0
"This place has a good ambiance and is a treat for people wanting to take pictures but that's about it.

Went on a Sunday and there was no crowd at all. The AC was literally non functional which made it uncomfortable considering the heat outside. The service was on the slower side and the mocktails were underwhelming. Starters were brought to the table and while they tasted good, the pace of refills needed to improve.

I honestly liked the veg biriyani and the schezwan fried rice from the main course. The stone ice cream in the desserts section was worth a mention and that's about it.

It's expensive factoring in the food and service you get. These guys need to pull up their socks if they want really survive in a competitive environment. Could give it a try for the ambiance though.",1
"Excellent service and food buffet! This place has really warm service and they are always willing to customise the menu since it becomes repetitive otherwise. The pocket pinch is slightly higher, but it's totally worth it.

Then best starters are Cajun potato, crispy corn, mushrooms, dahi kebabs, corn tikki. All the starters are lip-smacking. Make sure to keep room for the main course.

I haven't tried many options from the main course, though, dal makhani and rice is a very comfortable choice.

Coming to desserts, gal Jamuns are literally out of the world. Try them with a scoop of vanilla ice-cream. You wouldn't want to eat them anywhere else! Alongside, pan kulfi is a must try. üòçüò¨ there are a plenty of other desserts to choose from.

Always up for a BarBQue grill üçñ",2
The last time i went to this restaurent the food was not so good as it was very salty and service was also very slow. I called the waiter to change my dish as it was very salty he did‚Äôt change it he just modified it and gave it back. Then i called him again for the same reason then he finally got it replaced and gave me the new dish that was also pathetic. #Nevervisit,0
"Beautiful ambience. The vintage look took me back to some good old days. The food was okay but they take quite some time to bring in the order. For instance, 30 min for a glass of Coke? We had been here for dinner and it took us a while to figure out that both urban Asia and Eat India company are together. The staff didn't attend us for a long time. I gave the 3 star for the ambience and the experience I had with the people I went with.",1
"More expensive than the other barbecue counterparts but once you experience this place, you will realise why it's worth every penny. From the starters to the main course. Everything was rich in flavour and taste. Softest mutton sheekh kebab ever I tasted here. The menu didn't include mutton keema, yet our waiter Gopal served us some with pav and ghee naan. His hospitality is worth mentioning. The head chef came and took our feedback. Very warm ambience, good people and great food. Don't miss this place.",2
not good,0
"Ok-ish food and price and taste doesn‚Äôt tally.

Ok-ish ambience

Not so great place to sit and have a chat, as it also combines with Tiki Shack and Urban Asia under one roof you felt that I was sitting in some crowded place",1
"Barbeque was good in taste. Quality of fish chicken mutton was perfect. Though main course variety was less, overall i liked the place. Diligent service by all staffs. The head chef also wanted feedback for the food, which i personally like very much! Happy to visit another time!",2
I ordered butter chicken but got paneer,0
"Happened to visit this place for dinner on last Sunday. The ambience is amazing with decor pieces from Rajasthan. They have used various elements in a smart way. We opted for a dinner buffet. The variety of items in the buffet were good. But starters were served cold on the table. This place is decently priced. I personally loved the Thai soup, chicken kabab, butter naan and dal.
Food : 3.5/ 5
Ambience : 4/5
Service :4/5",1

"#Disappointed

Went for dinner with friends. Was bit disappointed with the service and food. Firstly due to lack of space they have clubbed Urban Asia nd Eat India on the same floor. Which make service bit slow and confused.
We opted for buffet, here also they served fusion of both the restaurant. For example they served chicken sorba for non-veg and Khaw-Souy for veg.
It's simply confusing and making ur dinning experience not that great.",1
"It‚Äôs a hell of party when you land with your colleagues or friends at barbecue nation. I should not say about the tenderness of grilled fish, chicken and mutton kebabs being served as starters but also about the veg dishes that grabbed my attention. The main course meals were really nice and dessert was also pretty good for the meal package. It‚Äôs a must option if you are choosing for corporate meals, birthday celebrations or friends hangout.",2
not good this time,0
Pretty average fare.. tried the paneer lababdar and zafrani chicken .. just about fine.. the butter nan had very little butter.. service is good .. the waiters were very attentive and cheerful .. eat India company and urban Asia share the same kitchen and floor .. so one can order from either menus..they also have a buffet on the table.. however we tried the ala Carte,1
We went here from office. A group of 17 members. We were the first so seating was not an issue. I had veg starters and it was marvellous. For once the spice levels matched my lower than normal Hyderabad spice margins. The paneers were too soft for the skewers and kept dropping into the fire. The corn fried were very good. Food was excellent especially the sweet corn soup. Desserts we very good. On the whole a satisfying experience.,2
"This outlet has been secluded from the limelight of the Kondapur gachibowli stretch but still manages to garner a decent amount of crowd.

The ambiance is pretty ambivalent with that of a buffet restaurant and casual dining space. It was well lit but could really deck up a few notches. It was more like a corporate dining room rather than a restaurant.

Upon arrival, were served welcome drink which was good but not living up to the expectation. We were asked if we are here for buffet. The restaurant it seems is more concentrated on buffet. I had a look at the menu and it didn't interest me.

The manager at this place was a nice fellow. Who carefully took our order of dragon chicken, punjabi chicken curry, and garlic naan. After a fair bit of waiting time, we're served with dragon chicken.

I would have like the dish to be more crispy and dry, so that the flavours stick to the chicken. It was a hurried preparation of a dish with no amount of time spared for presentation.

The servers need to be taught a little bit about serving. They were fumbling and also were handling hot utensils without using tissue papers.

Then we move on to punjabi chicken curry and garlic naan. Simply put, it was a disaster. The curry was as bland as it could be. Most restaurants in this part of India assume that all dishes of Punjab are made with tandoori chicken and they seriously need to get out of this blind belief. We could only experience the tandoori chicken as the curry had no taste of its own. It was just sitting there doing nothing. Neither it was spicy, not it was tangy. It was going nowhere.

The problem here doesn't lie with the chefs. It lies with the restaurant which is confused in what they are trying to do. They say they are multi cuisine, but multi cuisine doesn't mean, you can make disaster dishes and pass them off. I am not a fan of multi cuisine. When you have such a title, you should at least try to make it work for you. The restaurant is confused whether it should cater to immigrant North Indian population or the traditional South Indian population.

One thing that screams out their confusion about the above is their Buffet menu. They tried to make it a fusion and have ended it making a confusion.

Had the restaurant, been a traditional southern one, I would have been pleased to order a plate of traditional andhra chicken on a banana leaf and would have eaten to my hearts content.

The restaurant needs to find its footing. The owners need to decide which way they want to go. Maybe hire some traditional North Indian guys for North cuisine.

"Descent place. Nice and different Ambience. Buffet was ok ok. It started on a high note with Chicken Shorba followed by starters and main course. And as we were moving to main course taste of food was not great. It was either too much salt or garlic ginger paste.

All starters were really nice. Mutton Rogan Josh was best. Thai Green Curry with Steam Rice was delicious. Desert we're hardly available and no one even bothered to refill. Service was nice. Over all ok ok. May be second visit will think and decide if no option available.",1

Good ambience but average vegetarian food....it was just like any other restaurant....we order paneer tikka and nawabi handi....tikka was fine but handi was very average...,1
Barbeques are one of my favorites. Barbeque Nation is a perfect blend of good food and Ambience. Always been best at servicing. Would be better if they try something new for birthday wishes.,2
worst quality . i was never this much disappointed in my whole life. what kind of packing is that? next time try to give more quantity,0
"Been here for lunch and opted for ala carte..

Must trys - corn cubes
Turn offs - extremely slow service, desserts

FOOD - 3.5/5 - tried corn cubes, crispy potato with butter chilli garlic sauce, paneer lababdar, mint and lemon Ice cream.

Corn cubes 5/5 - one of their unqiue dishes. Simply loved it. A highly recommended starters you need to try here.

Crispy Potato 4/5 - tasty and light!

Paneer lababdar 3.5/5 - taste was quite different and paneer was fresh. The tangy taste was dominating and not all may like it.

Tandoor roti 3/5 - was hard.

Lemongrass and mint ice cream 2.5/5- I expected a single serve of ice cream with a mix of these 2 flavors, but I was served with these two separately. Mint ice cream was too strong and we didn't like it, lemongrass was avg.

AMBIENCE 4/5 - decent ambience for a family dining..

SERVICE 2/5 - extremely slow. Had to remind 2-3 times to get our order. This definitely has to be improvised.",1
Food is good. The service from the staff is excellent. Worth every rupee. Reasonable price when compared to other barbeque.. service from the staff is excellent...,2
"Good ambience.good spread, buffet for dinner yesterday night.Highly dissapointed about the vegetarian curries which were rottened, 2 out of three were rottened. The triple pudding in the deserts with rottened fruits was pathetic. Overall vegetarian food for the buffet was ignored by the restaurant. Pls do takecare #bananaleaf, don't dissapoint your customers.",0
"Decent Ambience with light music. Taste of food - Not that great, No much Varieties in buffet. In all, it is not worth the money spent.
They really need to keep more varieties.
No salads.
only 3 desserts including ice cream.
So, it was an average experience",1
"Serving is nice,food is good starters are good enough to get a 3 star main course is excellent when compared to absolute barbecues but star of the show is malai kulfi.absolute show.stopper of the buffet.",2
The worst biryani and tandoori I ever had! Looked like some leftover is delivered to me and so expensive. Idiots!,0
"Being a foodie and going for a buffet is like craving for a lump sum treat!
But the restaurant has disappointed.
1. Ambience and service was great.
2. We went for buffet , firstly the starters weren't that good at taste. Common panner kebab type of starter, corn , chicken, veg kebab. Well none o them weren't good as having them twice.
3. Main course was a disaster, very few choices that too of rare vegetables and less eaten. No panner the main dish, rice items weren't good. Skipped and went to the desert section.
4. Desserts was like stabbing a dead man. Nothing exciting, only the ice cream was good.

Overall, it is expensive and less satisfying. If you are hungry and looking for a buffet please skip this one.",1
Good place for birthdays and similar events. Wide variety of food items available. Had visited the place during some fest wherein I found lots of varieties.,2

"Eat India Company is attached to Urban Asia.
We tried out their buffet.

"Visited this place on our marriage anniversary. Food was excellent. especially the starters. liked the mutton sheek kebab more. meat was tender and tasty. bbq prawns were good as well. veggies will love crispy corn here. Can improve on the desserts variety.
Service was excellent. Right from the valet guy to the manager, every one were courteous.
Azad who served food for us was very assistive and always checked if we needed anything. Chef was kind enough to ask us about the food and cooked chicken specially for us which was terrific. All seemed perfect for a perfect day.",2

Starting from Welcome Drink till the complimentary cake , the food was so delicious.... Great Job !!!!",2
"A complete and absolute disaster. The place where we sat was dirty. There were cracks on the walls. We ordered the food to be less spicy but I guess they cook how they want to cook. The AC was non-existent. It felt like we were sitting in a tandoor. The service was pretty slow.  If you bring food you bring the starters together and then you don't put a gap in between the starters and the main course. The taste was appalling, sub-par service, being in one of the prime locations. I have ordered a lot of times from Kritunga Madhapur and that one is very good. I think Kritunga Gachibowli has a long way to go before it becomes worth the money. Wish them the best",0
"A group of 4, we decided to visit this place on Saturday evening. The location is quite on the main road, however, the parking and the entry is terrible. They can surely improve in this aspect as it can be a big turn-off.ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

After entering the restaurant, we were quite impressed with the ambience and the decor. It had a very India taste to it. They had old locks, keys, doors and other wooden stuff adding to the rustic look. üòç

Coming to the food, there is a plethora of options on their menu. Instead of going through it all, we decided to quickly take recommendations and order it with the bearer. Hariyali Paneer Tikka and Corn cubes made for the perfect starter combination. Corn cubes cannot be missed here. My friend ordered a Chicken starter which was quite average though. Moving to main course, we wanted to keep it simple with rotis and a few curries. Paneer Lababdar, Mushroom curry and Nizami Handi seemed like good choices. Food was decent.

The service was not impeccable. It ca surely be improved. Also, they did not even serve finger bowls at the end of our meal. Quite a surprise. üòë

The price point is a little on the higher side- probably much more than average. üòÖüòÖ It can be a great negative. They accepted gold on food, so yay!

Overall, a good experience, but probably not one worth visiting again.",1
"Have been there for our wedding anniversary. Excellent service provided be staff. Non veg starters were too good. Ambiance was also good. Didn't feel the main course that great compared to starters (Didnt like Chicken Dum biryani). Enjoyed desserts a lot especially Kulfi

"Hi,

I have ordered king of kodi pulao, Never expect too much from the title of the food. It is the worst thing I have ever eaten on this planet. The chicken is undercooked, The rice is giving a weird smell. As it is not cooked today. I have ordered Paya as well. I don't know if it is fat or oil but it's too spicy and oily. This is not the adept quality of Kritunga because I have been eating in this cuisine for more than three years. It's getting worse every year.",0
"It was supposed to be a really casual lunch and we didn‚Äôt expect this place to be nice but were surprised for sure.

So it‚Äôs a nice restaurant with well arranged furniture and light. Has a buffet lunch which is very convenient for Software professionals and casual lunches with friends.

I have small complaints which are listed in the end but apart from that I had a nice time.

So in the spread, something that I loved dearly was the Chilly Prawns. I just couldn‚Äôt get enough of it. It was amazing.
The chicken was alright. But I can say but prawns were the best. Although they were really small, but can‚Äôt complain much. They didn‚Äôt give us fish even after we asked for it.

Staff: attentive and service was okay.

Ambience: very nice place, looks good, clean, effort was put in to make it look nice.

Food: food was definitely good I liked it quite a lot apart from the desserts. They were pretty bad.

Complaints: Starting with the ice cream guy- they have a cold stone ice cream. He broke a water glass on the bar counter while making ice cream (technically just mixing it) and he used his already worn gloves and ice cream scoop to push the glass pieces away. Didn‚Äôt wash his hands or change his gloves or wash his scoop. For all we know the glass pieces were still on his hands and scoop.

Second is also with the ice cream guy, we found hair inside the ice cream he made us and returned it immediately. Lost our appetite soon after that.

Third is with one of the waiters, probably didn‚Äôt want to give us fish even after we asked him to get us some which was on the buffet menu. He agreed to get some but never showed up with it. I hope it‚Äôs his memory and nothing else that caused the problem.

Hopefully management reads this and takes action on it.

If those factors are avoided, then will go again definitely.",1
"A place to go with friends and family. Hospitality is just at the next level. Staffs are very polite and know how to delight the customers. Well, starters and deserts are simply awesome. I don't munch much on the main course (not enough space left after yummy starters).
I liked the way staff took my concern regarding pastry where I felt contained an egg (I am vegetarian). They not only ensured me that the said pastry is egg less but also offered me special chocolate chips icecream. You guys are just too good in the hospitality. Will love keep coming back there.",2

I‚Äôve been to other kritunga‚Äôs many times since 6 years and never was disappointed. Ragi sankati one of the benchmark dishes served by kritunga was bad and I‚Äôm hesitating to use the word worst.

"After a lot of reco-s and solid rating everywhere, I finally tried out Driven Cafe - mainly to sample their coffee. Unfortunately, I was disappointing with the Cappuccino. Tried a 'medium' Cappuccino - which is a double expresso shot coffee with foamed milk, and it was very underwhelming. No aroma, no kick, it was very bland and generic. Had a hard time getting through it. 
The wife tried Frappe, which was as per her taste and my daughter (who has a major sweet tooth) found her choco chip brownie nice. However, I was quite disappointed overall.",1
"You hear about a place a 100 times, how do you solve the puzzle when you visit it once to experience it yourself... Being a foodie it's important we suss things out in person. One of the puzzle I came across was this place Absolute Sizzler I had mixed reviews and I said let me.try. been here and loved the place.. people have lot of different views and takes on Sizzler's and how they expect it to be like a Dhaba style .... Here it's a fusion of both Desi and videsi tadkaa... So keep an open mind to ravish some delicious sizzlers.... I give a happy 4/5.",2
Very less chicken piecec in chiken biryani... Very spice its like red mirchi rice.. No flavour of biryani... Worst biryani ever... Very much unsatisfied,0
The place is good and the ambience too but the food is expensive and lacks taste.For bike lovers it's a place to try on and just have a normal breakfast can't prefer more than that.,1

Especially lunch buffet was great n Sizzlers also",2
"It was supposed to be Nellore Fish Pulusu. What I got delivered tasted only like fish and warm water. No salt, no spices, no chillies. Just some pieces of fish and put into coloured warm water. Worst fish curry I had ever. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è",0
"The best thing about this cafe is that it is open 24x7.
There are lot of beverage options, a few bakery options and very little food options. The ambiance is great for bike enthusiasts, but if you aren't one it is only average for you. They play really good music though.
The food is only average.",1

"Great place to hangout and chill with friends. We just went for a drive around 12.30 and ended up here !
The ambience was pretty cool !
We tried garlic bread, with brownie and a cold coffee !
Brownie was little disappointing i would say, too sweet !
Though Coffee was pretty good !
Garlic bread was ok , it could have been little more crisp !
Will definately like to try out once more with pizzas and pasta !",1

asked for solution wasn't provided.
poor service in online way",0
"Explored this place today and was surprisingly very good because it never occurred me to try out for this long. Has an American cafe ambiance and feel and is open until 1 AM at least. The cheese garlic bread, veg puffs and Latte coffee were pretty good. It's self service and the order came in pretty quick. One and only suggestion is that maybe they can focus a little more on cleanliness. Overall, a good place for a quick catch up with friends over a bite.

As a sizzlers Fan went to longe my taste buds with sizzlers.Order Fish n chips along with chilly chicken for straters and oh my fell in love with fish n chips.. Chicken Sizzlers were really gud... Loved the ambience and the music.. worth visiting the place.. Fish n chips are must try.,2

"worst biriyani ever had. there was some small pieces of chicken curry (dry) placed over some rice.

Good ambience. A place for grabbing quick bites. Service was a bit late. Heard that this place serves good coffee..I had cold coffee which was very bad surprisingly!,1
It is a very good place for sizzelers. Loved the person who was singing der. A very good experience overall. Loved the food and the food was served on time and food was amazing. It was a very good experience for my family and me. I would recommend this place to all my friends and aqueitence.,2
no taste,0
"Since it was the festive season, and I wanted to try Navratri specials at Faasos. Tried their Singhada ke aloo parantha, Paneer Makhanwala, Sabudhana ki kheer, Green tomato curry and Curd. 
It was not as expected. Did not taste quite well. The parantha was a bit soggy and the curry was not up to the mark. The kheer was not sweet enough. Not a big fan of their Navratri box.
I was disappointed with the food, though the food came in nice packaging. Very neatly packed but taste was not so neat.
Need to improve a lot.",1
Simple place but very tasty sizzlers. Portioning for the sizzlers are also excellent. Service was also good. I tried one of the chicken sizzlers and loved the plating and all the added stuff that came along.,2
food not good because biryani rice not spicy just plain rice given to me,0
"Its the festive season and I wanted to try the navrathri Thali. I tried my hand at Faasos. The Thali was well presented, the rotis were a bit hard. Sweet is average. Slightly Less sweet because of the festival. I like the paneer. And by the time the raita reached me, it was off. Bitter in taste. Overall experience neither positive nor negative.",1
This is the best place for those who live sizzlers which is best and cheaper food in this place is good but the deli ery of the food is bit slower as compared to other,2
very spicy and not so tasty,0
"My actual rating is 3.5...I ordered veg wraps few days back.. Service was quick..I must say packaging was really good..

I ordered veg cheesy melt paneer wrap and paneer Tikka wrap. They also served tikha masala with wrap..Those who love spicy food must like this masala...

Cheesy melt paneer wrap was outstanding...Cheese was busting in mouth with each bite..paneer and gravy was really tasty..It has Punjabi flavor with cheese combination..Loved it..

Paneer wrap - It was average in taste as the gravy was little bland and plus it has cheakpea curry which annoyed me a lot.. taste was not good..

My experience was good..

"#Vegetarian Review

I got a cheese paneer roll and a paneer tikka masala roll to review.
If you've to order one among the two go for the paneer tikka masala roll. It had right amount of spices. The cheese paneer roll was too bland. It had just a lot of cheese and paneer but no spices to make it tasty.

The quantity was good enough for one. Would have loved it even more if they would have made cheese and masala as a combination.

However, Do try the paneer tikka masala roll if you're craving for some snacks‚ù§Ô∏è",1
"Absolute sizzler is absolutely fantasy and lovely.I'm blessed and pleased to been here.Its like heaven on earth.The foods are delicious and it was delivered on time.Love to visit again and again...I feel like home,the staffs are also good and frank.KEEP IT UP ABSOLUTE TEAM",2
bad,0
The one I ordered (Chicken wrap) would have been 5 star but the amount of salt you added was unbearable. Do something about it and also the rice dish was fine,1

I hace tried faasos a multiple times. I got two wraps through a food review programme. The cheesy melt paneer wrap wasn't cheesy at all. The jumbo chicken wrap was good quantity wise but was very spicy.,1

Great service...

"The place was in a very high end location. The ambience was not up to the mark. The service seemed pretty hostile when we asked them basic questions. And when we asked them to pack some of the remaining food, they didn't seem too happy about it. The appetizers and soup were good, but the quantity was too little. We ordered the ""Classic Mezeh Platter"" and when asked for some pita bread, the waiters frowned upon us and did not give us an appropriate response. Overall the place is overpriced and the service needs to be improved.",0
parathas were not up to the mark.,1
"It's great place to with family and friends ..
Great food n great hospitality....thanks team absolute....

We want to visit again and highly recommend",2
"2 stars for the place for rest 3, need good food, service, presentation and experience

Lets start with the good part for which the two stars.

Ambience , location and the place is amazing nothing like other places in hyd. The rain today made it even better. Outdoor has this chil lounge vibe with good house music and indoor being this good energy family or dinner vibe.

Thats it to the place and good part!

Service was bad, food was ok. If a restaurant does not serve filter water it is a huge problem. Buying water is a choice not force. Doesn‚Äôt matter if you are local udipi or a five star. We were told we dont have filter water something is broken so you buy. While leaving we did see other tables served normal water.

We did have zomato gold to use, but the experience was not so great to use it. First turnoff , dont have kingfisher beers.

We ordered veg tandoor platter, margherita pizza , tiramisu and cheesecake.

Pizza was the best part and yet i would say a 3.5/5. Generous amount of sauce and cheese but 3 basil leaf to count. We asked for mustard and denied.

The platter had many things but of of which was paneer tikka n no grilled onion or peppers or tomato. Whole platter didnt come with any onion et al side. Extra chutney took forever to come.

Tiramisu was average will not try again or recommend

Cheesecake was pretty bad. Packed to throw i guess. The blueberry on it ...is red color which is super confusing. The creamcheese itself i would guess will be cheaper kind making it hard.

They gave a birthday brownie, Which frankly was average too. However, the server comes and tells me during payment, i have not charged you for brownie. WTF!!!!!

Overall i will recommend to go to njoy the place and have few drinks. Hop to jonathans for food or some place in indiranagar.",0
"*zomato food review program
I have ordered for Cheesy chicken buna wrap and
Double cheese meat ball wrap. The quantity was good enough loved the meat ball wrap food was not hot by the time it was delivered.",1

Good food n great service....
We want to visit again.........

Great experience.......

Thank you team absolutely absolute sizzlers",2
There were mosquitoes in the restaurant. The food was ok but there was a hygiene concern. The pickled carrot was stale and had fungus. The waiter replaced it but this is not expected of such a high profile restaurant.,0
I have received one gulab jamun only wherever I ordered for 2.apart from this food is good.,1
"Its great palace to dine food was great
Service also good
Ambiance also cool we want visit again
Especially spice chicken sizzlers
Thanks team absolute sizzler

Keep up the good work",2
"The food is decent but the place and service is extremely horrible. Went there for dinner with my family and we were bombarded with mosquitoes all around us, even though we were sitting indoors. Called the manager for this situation and was told that they can't do anything about it. Brilliant customer service!",0
Highly overpriced,1
"absolute sizzlers located at Snl terminals Level 3

Amazing food, tasty finger food I recommend Cheese stuffed mushroom & Fish n Chips and many more to try.
When coming to Sizzlers, Fish shashlik sizzler is the best.
Must try caramel custard and Sizzling brownie dessert.

* highly recommended Best sizzlers restaurant
We will visit again",2
Avoid this place in summer due to outside seating. They do not even have coolers in such weather outside and it is an expensive place. Not worth,0
The wraps are good but over priced. The add-ons are also expensive. I had to pay around Rs.20 to add fiery sauce to the wrap I ordered. Any wrap beyond Rs.100 is over priced for me. The rice bowls are decently priced and the taste is okay but can be better.,1
Prakash served us food . He is very generous and did tell us the speciality .. must try grilled chicken sizzler and sizzling brownie.. they are just awesome.,2
"We visited the restaurant yesterday. We got outside table as all insides were reserved. Being 42 degrees outside, they only had fans running in such upscale restaurant and mist fans. They are charging 1400 RS for buffet and is considered upscale restaurant. Quite amazed on how upscale restaurants cannot afford coolers. Felt bad for waiters also as they were fully sweating and running around..I had same experience few months back. We went in th evening and it rained. We took the outside seating due to nice weather plus all the water was gushing inside and they had nothing to prevent that. I liked the food here but if management can't simply think abt service, I am sure we can figure out other places to eat.",0
paratha was very oily,1
Sizzlers are too good. Prakash served it really well and explained about the food is really impressive. Must try here the grilled chicken sizzler and the sizzling brownie,2
"Can improve your main course and desserts spread. I would have rated 3 but I am giving a 1 because one of your servers' behavior was bad in our office party. When my friend asked for a blue lagoon, he insulted him in front of everybody by saying that blue lagoon is for kids, not men... just because it's a soft drink. One need not believe in others' beliefs and customs, but at least respect them and not insult them. Train your staff appropriately.",0
Small quality but tasty,1
"Food was too good, tried spicy chicken sizzler and lal maans lamb sizzler, liked the behaviour of Prakash, will recommend it to friends and visit again.",2

Lots of mosquitoes. Staff won't care to put some mosquito repellant either.",0
Food quality was good. very overpriced,1
"Best Sizzlers in Hyderabad till date. Very good staff service. I love this place.

Grilled Fish Sizzler is mouth watering. You can try Seekh kebab Paneer tikka sizzler also time if you‚Äôre a Vegan.",2
"Tasty food, nice ambience, courteous staff. But zomato gold offers are not honored half of the times, depending on their mood. Service could be faster.",0
I have ordered egg biryani from this restaurant. Taste wise not that much superb.But quantity wise it was more. I will give 3/5 for taste. But online order came very early. I can appreciate for restaurant fast service.,1
"This place is good for a casual lunch and dinner with friends or family. This place offers a wide variety of Sizzlers and other Starters and Main Course as well . During my last 2 visits I‚Äôve tried a non veg Platter, 2-3 different types of non-veg Sizzlers, Tikka Pizza with add-ons like fries üçü n all.

While the food they serve is good but they could do better with service.
Service isn‚Äôt up to the mark , once your order is taken it‚Äôs lost somewhere until it really arrives at your table (after 20 mins ) and once the food is at your table the waiter will never show up again to ask if you need anything else or how‚Äôs the food??!!. Well not just that ask for a chutney or Mayonnaise or a water bottle you ain‚Äôt getting it until you call up to them couple of times.",2
"It was a busy day which turned into an unplanned dinner at this place. I reserved a table for us on the same day itself. To start with i really liked the ambience of this place and the view which it had. I was delighted to see the place at first. Contrarily i was dissapointed as there were initially no one to recieve us (after reserving the table) and then we ourselves had to ask the management to set up the table for us, as expected every other waiter was in a hurry and they set up an eneven table for us in a shabby manner (like local restraunts) and they gave us the menu. The waiter had no idea abt the dishes and its contents, we asked abt a starter which was made of lotus stem for which he just nodded his head for watever we said. I would say the food was not really upto the mark and the prices were on the higher side, the food was not worth the price, it tasted more like any other local restraunt. The starters being prawns and another vej starter which was made of lotus stem were below average. Coming to the main course we had ordered the butter chicken curry with rice. I would say the butter chicken tasted very bland, it was sweet and barely had any flavour, seemed like they just boiled the chicken in a sause and got it for us, overall a bad experience.




verdict - on the face of it,the ambience was nice, the service and food were not upto the mark. Very dissappointing indeed.",0
ok,1
"Food is incredible. I have visited several times but still the menu has lot of items to cover. The staff is very friendly and Shravan Kumar is very much good at his service and also in ambience. A must visit place.
Spicy chicken Sizzler with noodles is ultimate here.",2
"Went for lunch along with my colleagues and ordered Salad, Lasagna, Chicken Pan Fried Noodles with Black Bean Sauce and Tiramisu.
Service was average standard, in terms of food the only thing I like was the Chicken Pan Fried Noodles as it had my favourite Black Bean Sauce.",0
"Food Package is ordinary, I think with the same reason food is going to taste less.",1
"The place where to dine finely and with good ambience treating very well with their service
As well as delicious food these things we could find only at the absolute sizzlers",2

average,1
"Spacious ambience. Amazingly friendly staff. Quick service. Good food. I ordered Cottage Cheese Steak Sizzler. Garlic sauce base with noodles and fries. The steak was delicious. Fries were crispy. Noodles were bland. Had to ask for extra garlic sauce. One sizzler is enough for any individual with a decent appetite. May visit this place if you are craving for sizzlers.

Might burn your pocket if you don't have Zomato Gold.",2

Awesome food great taste and great people ....good ambiance waiters are soo kind üòé@sravan Is really soo nice üëç my fav is pasta here üòç read sauce creamy pasta üçù,2
"I had heard a lot about Glass Onion, but came back extremely disappointed. The only reason I've given it 2 stars is because of the nice staff and the gorgeous ambience. The food is over priced and the quantity they give us is way too less. We ordered the lamb lasagna and we literally had ONE piece of lasagna which really shocked me. Then we had the chicken steak which was decent - nothing special. We gave up on their main courses so went straight to desserts. We ordered the warm apple pie, cheesecake, and the Brazilian chocolate cremeux. The chocolate dessert tasted old, the cheesecake was a thin slice of sadness, but the warm apple pie was very good. Overall, never coming here again and don't recommend to anyone",0
food was not cooked....half fried chicken lolipop,1
"Value for money - yummy sizzlers at throwaway prices! However decking up of the restaurant as well as air conditioning doesn‚Äôt seem to work too well. Overall a very good deal at the offered prices.
PS: Please increase the sizzling menu and decrease ‚ÄúIndian‚Äù servings since this place is meant to serve sizzlers absolutely! Cheers!",2
"Went here for lunch on a weekday with less crowd. Still pathetic service. Awful food. It took almost 20 min for the food to arrive. Another 20 min for even the bill to arrive.
Not recommended. Avoid it.",0
"Just your normal cafe, nothing out of the ordinary.

Very slow and inattentive service. Okay food. Coffee not that great.

The only thing I would think of ordering on repeat would be the spinach and mushroom pie and maybe the blueberry Danish.

Value for money could be better.

Not at all inpressive :/",1

. Worth if you have zomato gold too. Shankar who served us very polite. Will be visiting once again soon.",2
"We went as a group of 5 on a saturday night.
The ambiance and decor was good. Mosquito filled.

We had ordered
3mushroom soup : decent
Margarita pizza: we asked for a slight customization but sss not adhered to but given his own will on it
Quinnoa chat : surprisingly different and nice
Battered fish : decent
Kun pao chicken: succulent meat ... done well
Teriyaki mushroom: tasted more sour than like teriyaki
Borcolli kababs : melt in the mouth
Noodles were done well
Lamb in lemon butter sauce : i think a wrong dish of lamb was served
Cheese cake : done well..
Apple pie : okayish

All in all the food was decent but the service was pathetic.
We moved from outside to inside ac due to mosquitos and the rooms were also mosquito filled .. when asked he bluntly cited that there is nothing they could do.

The staff have no clue of the menu. Also food is not served in time, the lamb came 20 minutes after we finished rest of the maincourse.

"This place is located opposite to Deloitte towers, with the limited seating you will find it mostly over crowded. The ambiance has a vintage feel as soon as you enter.
I ordered Paneer chilli pizza, peach iced tea,chilly cheese tpast and pink sauce pasta...all of them were okayish.
Pizza was perfect indian pizza, tasted like panner chilly gravy on pizza base and pasta also had a very Desi taste to it, they put carrots in pasta which didn't go well at all.I only like the chilly cheese toast which were toasted to perfection.

Price-3/5
Food-3/5
Service-3/5

The management was too ignorant ... Said the same thing multiple times all to deaf ears .
There's nothing that was too good about it.
The food was below average and too pricy for the portion and taste they serve.
Won't recommend.",0
I personally liked the bagel with cheese and capuccino. There was some renovation work happening outdoors when we visited this place. We were disturbed by the noise and hence couldn't stay longer. Good for groups.,1

"Why you have changed the menu guys. And the new menu is pathetic. I miss that old cottege cheese steak, enchiladas and lots of great items. Please revert it. I am rating 1 star for new menu, it's tasteless. Unecessary change. I was regular but now don't want to come after trying the new menu.",0

Veg Sizzlers we ordered are not upto the mark.
It can be improved more.

Over all it's ok for one time visit.",2
Came here with my Family after 2-3 months and ordered usual chinese combo . They have changed their menu and made it more south Indian than continental like before . In chinese combo they gave us noodles topped with Paneer 65 ( with all curry patta and mustard seeds) This use to be my go to place until last year because of the freindly staff and variety in continental menu . They changed their menu and the new taste is not worth it.,0

Ordered the Thai green curry, was just a watery mess, probably the worst ever had.
Kung Pao chicken was overly sweet, the noodles were just tossed around in a few eggs and probably 2 pieces of chicken.
The rice was very dry giving us an overall average experience.",0

"A Friday outing in Absolute Sizzlers. Quite pocket friendly option (even more if you have Zomato gold).
Had ordered Mushroom sizzler and Chicken sizzler. The portion is enough for 1 person. We had ordered French fries as side dish.

"Had a very disappointing experience. The place didn't do justice to it's rating. I don't know what happened, maybe the chef had a bad day or maybe that's how the food generally is. Ordered fries with cheese which was poorly seasoned, the fish in fish and chips was literally dripping in oil. There didn't seem any effort put into the Potato wedges that come on the side of the burger. The service was good.. if only food was half as decent!",0
I paid additional amount to add chiken to the pasta but the pasta that came had nothing.,1
One of the best places for sizzlers in Hyderabad. A must visit if you are planning for a sizzling lunch or dinner. They serve a variety of sizzlers here worth trying.,2
The food was not good as expected. The service could have been better. Please concentrate on taste . This place is not for lunch better try for dinner,0
"Ordered Red Sauce Veg Pasta got it delivered at friends house and the taste was not that great average and the richness in the pasta was lagging .

I felt it could have been better with the gravy and sauce a Lil thick it was a but watery ...

Heard a lot from this place a bit disappointed. .. hoping to get to order again and hopefully it will be better",1
I loved it it is just awesome when super super super supersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersupersuper I can not anything more than this,2
Worst restaurant. They mentioned on Zomato gold but denied during order. They mentioned we earlier on Zomato gold we now not accept it.i felt cheated on Zomato gold if restaurant will deny such a way,0
"The croissants served with scrambled eggs is an awesome start for the day. The scream led eggs are really nice, soft and delicious but I was disappointed by the special omelette, which is costlier than the scrambled eggs but not tastes better than that. I tried scrambled eggs , omelette and special omelette. I must say that scrambled eggs are my favourite.",1
"Best sizzlers place in Hyderabad

Great food
Wonderful service
Nice ambience we want to visit again
highly recommend
For food

Thankq team absolute sizzles",2
"Had a very disappointing experience here today. We had been eyeing this place since long and planned our brunch to be had here. Loved the place, it was spacious and the ambiance was really good. The first thing I ordered was coffee but they were not serving any hot beverages. Next wanted to try pizza as they serve in different shapes but that too was unavailable. Did not felt like ordering anything after this. Highly disappointed.",0
Especially when you thought that this place was closed down the surprise when you find it to be open and running as efficiently and beautiful years before you immediately want to enjoy the food and so I did it was extremely delicious and lip smacking and I also recommended 20 of my friends to visit there I hope this restaurant gets more business I would like to give this place Four Stars,1
Great sizzlers.. Enjoyed it thoroughly. Nice place to hang around with colleagues or friends. I recommend to try this place and food.. Amazing combos are offered by this restaurant.,2
Food tastes good however had bad experience with freshness of food being served. Happened once at eating out at restaurant and second time while ordered home delivery.,0
"I bought an assortment of bakery products from here but I have to say I've had far superior before. The pastry was alright, the cookie was too moist, the banana cake was good and the croissants were soggy.

Overall, just a one time visit.",1
"It's a decent place with decent food and average service.
Pricing is excellent and value for money is amazing.
Please improve on your ambience and service and this place will be excellent!
Verdict : Good place to Eat.",2
"Deli 9 staff didn‚Äôt have the basic courtesy to inform that for 4 diners, it would be appropriate to unlock 2 Golds. They gave only 1 dish feee whereas we had ordered total of 7 across 4 diners.",0
"The Old Madras has been our go to place for some nice coffee with a sandwich whenever the weather is nice and you want to enjoy it sitting outdoor.

The coffee is quite good, with a lot of variations available. The best part is the freshly baked breads. Those beautiful, soft breads make the sandwiches all the more tasty when grilled with butter. Even the puffs and Victoria cake are nice to have.

Coming to the worst part - the service. In all my visits over the past couple of months, this has been the biggest turn off about this place. Almost always, I had to go to the counter to place the order instead of a waiter coming over. Second would be the cleanliness of the outdoor seating. More often than not, you can see flies buzzing over the tables. Though the kitchen looks quite hygienic.",1
I ever feel bad at this place such a honor treating from service people very humble and tasty food really good to dine here the absolute sizzlers,2
"I had a nice dinner planned with my wife here. I have had lunch many times at this place, but that evening was special. We got a cockroach along with the meal. When complained the only thing they offered was to replace the dish.",0
"The restaurant is good, food is good. Ambience of the outdoor seating area is average. They really need to improve on the service front, it took the restaurant more than half an hour to prepare a coffee and a sandwich. There were no menus in the seating area. The setup is semi self service. You have to go to the counter to give the order but they will serve you at your seat.",1
"I had lunch in absolute sizzler it was an amazing experience great food n great staff with friendly atmosphere , special thanks to Srinivas Rao for his personalized service. We will come back again",2
"Lol. I paid 345 bucks for what tasted like ready made pasta without any salt in it, along with a tiny, flaky piece of bread (that had neither butter nor garlic) wrapped in aluminium foil. I've seen more effort from places that charge 200 bucks for a dish. It was BAD. I counted three pieces of capsicum, total. Most half-assed pasta I've had in years. Super disappointed.",0
"I have been to this place many times. I feel their buffets need to improve. I just did not feel it to be upto the mark. The A la carte is far better. The decor s good, with really courteous staff.",1
"Absolute Sizzlers is absolutely best restaurant in town
We had great Sizzlers n service also excellent
Ambiance also good....

We want to visit again
Highly recommended",2
Allmost all items we ordered were tasteless. Plus service was average with guy taking orders appeared rude. He was behaving like he is owner and does not care if we come back again or not.,0
Chutney wasn‚Äôt good in taste. Rest was good.,1
Great food. Though options in menu can be increased. Pricing is decent with great taste and good service. Polite staff. Add more option in menu.,2
"Multiple bad experiences now. Food was bad. Waiter was impolite.While leaving , my car today got stuck in parking. Frio manager was outside and pretended to not hear me honking.",0

Will a try once again then come to an conclusion.",1
"Good place for food we want to visit again..
Food was superb n Nice service also ..
Ambiance also good...
This place located at SNL terminal level 3 part of food court",2
"This is one of the poor Italian restaurants in Hyderabad. The first giveaway was the menu cards. They were all torn and faded. Few of them even had the spiral binding missing in places.
The chairs and table cloth evinced that the restaurant was not very well maintained.

Coming to the food, I can say that it was very disappointing. We had ordered -
‚Ä¢Chicken Wings
‚Ä¢Tangy Arrabita Pasta
‚Ä¢Farmer's Ortalano
‚Ä¢Tiramisu

‚ñ™Ô∏éThe chicken wings were marketed as a spicy dish but the spice was no where to be felt. Also, the wings were glazed in two different sauces though they both tasted the same - Sweet and heavy.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe red sauce of the pasta was diluted .It was done to such an extent that the sauce was not willing stay with the penne pasta.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe pizza was the first relief, though it wasn't as it as some of the other restaurants. It was thin and it retained its shape.
‚ñ™Ô∏éThe tiramisu was a disaster. The cream was spoilt and the whole desert tasted sour. We had to send it back.

Finally, the service. The service was one of the very few worthwhile experience.

All in all, I will not visit this restaurant again and a do not recommend it to anyone.",0
Vada didn‚Äôt getfry inside... everything else good,1
"Absolutely
absolute sizzlers best sizzlers restaurant in Hyderabad....

Today lunch we visited this place food was delicious and service is simply amazing

Nice ambiance...

This place highly recommend üòç",2
"I wish I could make you taste the Chicken Nuggets. No offense for the people who liked it. But, i never had such worst food in my entire life. The dip they gave with French fries was one of a kind.i personally would not suggest this place to anyone.",0
nice,1
Where would like to have delicious food and good ambience seems and their service as well as I found these things at the absolute sizzlers only and they use to provide us nice buffet with 50 percent off on buffet that too very reasonable cost this is really good thing I loved it,2
My pizza looks like they have pieced together the left overs! The cheese is hard and the slices look old. I'm so disappointed as I order quite frequently from Frio and this is the second time I am getting a pizza in this condition from them.,0
Rice is not cooked properly . overall good,1
"Whoever people looking for delicious food and humble service at the place of absolute sizzler only i can say that I had good experience there especially i heard about that discount on ala carte menu and on the buffet 50%off that was really cool and great dine to have, at that reasonable price number of buffet items which were making us feel tasty thanks to absolute Sizzler's ....",2
"Went on a weekend afternoon with some friends and the place was completely empty!
The service was good but the food was not. The pasta was completely bland and the pizza too stretchy! When we told them to add some spices they just reheated the same and brought it back.
The ambience was okay, but not worth going just for that!
Not a good experience at all!",0
"Vada, Poha both were not good.... not cooked well. Tetrapack juice as chosen was not given. Food was not great.",1
This place is amazing for weekend fun hangouts and let your tireness go away. The DJ is awesome and plays best bollywood songs and punjabi too. The veg pizza and pastas are pretty good to try along with fruit punch. But if you want to have a good fun filled and energetic time go here. This place the best music to groove to and has pretty ambience to get clicked.,2
"Overall Experience : 2.5/5

Service : 3/5

Food Quality : I'm not able to decide.

 Taste : It was horrible for me

Value For Money : 3/5

I dont know why but I really didn't liked this place much. Usually I avoid bad ratings but for the first time I really left my fav. chicken wings on table. They were too bad in taste. Will attach the images soon (y)",0
ok to eat.,1
"I am absolutely in love with this place, not much hyped but still crowded. I recommend to visit on weekdays and weekends can get overcrowded. Pizza was good, so were the other titbits but what I liked most was there service, took time to place the order at the POS but the bartender whipped up my drink in no second bad I never had to call out for a repeat, it was ready each time. Overall I go to this place every other week one of the best party place around.",2
"We ordered food for home delivery with one line instruction ; garlic bread to be prepared without spices, which was not fulfilled. This was ok, what wasn't was delivery of chicken. We ordered vegetarian cheese balls and we received chicken! Can we ever trust you again, Frio Bistro!",0
"The restaurant was quite big and maintained very clean and neat with best hospitality .
Have been here on Friday evening , place was not much crowded and there was occupancy of only two tables .
Ordered the below :
Chicken tikka biriyani : This was mentioned as must try in menu card . It tasted good .
Tawa mutton biriyani : It tasted good with aromas of spices .
Paya soup : did not meet the expectations . It was not up to the mark . Tried tomato soup too . It did not taste well . Mushroom masala curry : quantity was very less and taste üëéüèª

Ambience : 4/5
Food : 3/5
Hospitality was good . They treated us as royal guest üòÄ",1
"This place is absolutely mind-blowing. Great music, great service, great food. It's crowded because so many wanna be here, is so epic! If you wanna spend some good time with your friends, dance your heart out, and blow off some steam, The Lal Street is the place for you.",2
"I had very high expectations from This one. But disappointed. Talking about food , the taste was below average. We ordered Pasta and pizzas both were not at all good. The only thing which i liked about this place is the Ambience. It's very decent. Coming to service, the waiters were very humble but our order took more than 1 hour to reach us to the table. Overall Below average experience . üòê",0
This restaurant is not for people who like dum biryani. Its a royal dining restaurant with that kind of interiors and biryani tastes good as well,1
"I have been to this place with friends for friday night. The place has amazing vibes. They were playing awesome bollywood numbers. The place was so crowded that it's do difficult to find a place to chill. Getting a table is task. Food is also good. One advice, go a little early. You will get place and even drinks will be at decent prices.",2
"This place was on my list for a long time.
Decided to check it out and was badly disappointed.

The mild mushroom soup was too bland and they don't serve a 1/2 of the soup. You will have to order 2 soups instead.

The Red Rooster pizza just didn't have any taste to it.
Gachibowli fried chicken was a disaster.

Stuffed grilled chicken breast was the only face saver at this place.

The regular water they served had dust floating on it, had to get bottled water.

Would never go to this place again. Won't recommend to anyone either.

The prices are on the higher side and they are just not worth it.",0
The restaurant and food was good we planned for buffet but unfortunately there was no buffet serving on Friday‚Äôs that thing I was not knowing. They should mention about the buffet serving days. Food was good biryani not up to the mark.,1
"This was a good place, cozy and outside seating arrangement was romantic. Amazing place for the get-togethers and for a bunch of friends. Food was okay. We had nachos, the salsa can taste better a bit, it was bland.
Ambience- 4.5/5
Service-3/5
Food-4/5",2
Very unprofessional staffs!! Don‚Äôt even know how to serve the food on request!! Whatever you will ask their 1st answer is ‚ÄúNo‚Äù. They also do have communication issues. Very disappointing!!,0
"Visited this branch with high expectations as the food in GVK One branch was too good, but food in this branch is not upto the expectationsz",1
"Went for lunch with friends.
Service and ambiance are good. I personally liked mocktail while food can be better.
The taste was not great while quantity is okay.",2
"The place had an amazing smell of bathroom pee when we entered. Hillariously the manager seemed barely aware of this horrible stench and promised to spray.

The lamb pizza which I suspect used the same sauce as the kheema was good but too salty likely cus it's meant to be eaten with spaghetti. The mezze platter is enough for one person barely. It's literally a single plate filled with 3 dips and 6 breads the size of a palm without fingers.

The desserts is where this place shines. They apparently think tiramisu is a soggy cake..? That fondant cake should taste still of maida because they didn't understand the concept and that managers should barely give a shit OR apologize.

Don't go its bad.",0
"Dishes Tried: Lal Mirch Tikka, Tundey Kebab, Rajwada Ghost

The food is okay not great, doesn't really live up to the hype. Tundey kebab was good but a little bit on spicy side. Rajwada Ghost was awesome.

goodespecially the Kabsa Laham. Its a must have for everyone. Grilled chicken was a let down though

The staff wasn't very welcoming when we mentioned we will using DineOut for payments and you could sense their attitude change. The ambience is pretty standard and looks empty.",1
Friday night visited there with my girl gang. I had booked the table in order to avoid any hastle. Was seated in a quiet corner on the deck side of the space. I loved the food they served‚Äî each and every item. The DJ for that night was very good and we danced till the last song! Only the service a bit dissatisfying because the bill was generated incorrectly and over the amount what we had consumed. Expect better care to be taken !,2
Somedays it's decent but somedays it's so not good. Yesterday we ordered fish paella and the rice was tasteless just dipped in chilli water. I love spicy food but not like this. We also ordered lamb bolognese and for both dishes it looks like they recycled the same generic masala mixture. It was so pungent.,0
The ambience of the place is great. The food was not to my liking. I have had better biriyani in Hyderabad. I ordered a mutton Roman Josh the meat was really hard.,1
"Cocktails were really good and service was cool and great atmosphere ,loved it, will be back again to enjoy the food and drinks...
Ambience 5/5
Service 5/5
Food 5.5/5",2
Good food but not very friendly customer service. The servers were way unfriendly. Overall average experience. Would request management to improve the quality of staff serving the food. Their attitude needs to improve.,0
"I ordered noodles and manchurian combo from this place, first of all i would like to suggest management to send fork along with the food as they have only sent the spoons and needless to say you cannot eat noodles from spoon. second the quantity was really less of manchurian. some improvement in food is suggested",1
"GOOD PLACE TO HANGOUT WITH FRIENDS. NICE MUSIC NICE AMBIENCE NICE FOOD.
It also has a outdoor seating so one who likes to have that seating. it is also a good place with good atmosphere.
Its a Bar Exchange so Order wisely that's the only thing to Take Care of.
If you are traveling to hyd. and don't want to go any random place for pubbing. You surely can rely on this place.",2
"Just be careful ordering here, they mix up vegetarian and non vegetarian food. It's a good chance that you get served a non vegetarian dish instead of veg version of the same. Staff is a bit clueless (lazy service). Overall ok place but runs well cause of location and big portion sizes. Nothing great or distinctive. This review is strictly based on lunch experience ; not sure if some magic is happening during dinner time.",0
"Food and ambience is average, waiter is not serving the food properly, we need to keep asking him to bring salads, chutneys and all, finally he demanded particular amount tip while paying the bill.",1
"To enter this bar, you have to go from the main entrance of the mall. There is no separate entrance to the bar directly which means that you have to pass all the people in the mall with your party wear. You may find it little bit awkward.

Coming to the bar interior, it is spacious, different seating arrangement, outdoor included. You better book table before reaching, otherwise it would be difficult to get table on a peak time esp weekends. We booked in advance but still we didn‚Äôt get the one with sofa, we got the table with bar chairs(tall).

We ordered Singapore Noodles, Mixed Fried Rice, Chicken Wet and white sauce Pasta.

Singapore Noodles - 5/5
Mixed Fried Rice - 5/5
Chicken Wet - 4/5
White Sauce Pasta - 2/5
They didn‚Äôt have pizza on the day we went.

Music- They played good English songs early and followed by hindi songs. Songs were very good.

Drinks - You have to order through their app. So we had to install and order. It was not very convenient. The price of drinks on the menu in Zomato has no relation with the actual price. Cocktails were very expensive comparing to the one it is shown on the menu.

Recommended",2
"The ambience is excellent , the food not so much , we ordered a half n half pizza , margarita & bbq chicken , the pizza was not up to the mark , now for the second dish we had ordered was Alfredo Chicken Pasta , the pasta sauce was very liquidish , chicken was undercooked. I am have visited this restaurant before & it was an awesome experience , we used Zomato good during this visit of ours , not sure if this has anything to do with the food taste , there were 2 pizza slices left & the the restaurant said they will not pack the leftover food as they said it was orders / rules from zomato , they said they would rather throw the left over in the dustbin but not give it to the customer , this is very strange rules , zomato relook at your guidelines",0
"Place was fine. And the food was okay. But i guess the people who served us was not sure about Zomato offers when you are a gold member.

It‚Äôs good for buffet, but I would not recommend for Zomato gold membership.",1
"Nice place to be. Super good food and drinks, friendly staff, cool ambiance. Enjoyed our time here.

Ok that‚Äôs it-(just trying fulfill the 140 characters rule üôÑ)",2
"after looking at all these good rdviews i thought the food would be great..but it was not..dominos pasta is far better than this,i orderd salsa pasta cost 415 rs..not upto the mark..then ordered few more veg items nd they were not good ..it does not justify the prices at all..i ate better pastas at my office restaurents at half the price..not happy with food quality. though ambience nd service was good...may b in veg they dont hve better quality food..",0
Food is good. Good for ordering for team lunch if you prefer not to go out. Ambience is not very good. This is my personal experience.No offense.,1
"Good concept, based on some other existing clubs though. There is a serious need of utilizing the space properly, which at present requires quite some work. Limited dance floor, have to be protected by bouncers, everybody blocks the road after last call but ignoring all that, food is good, Music is good, and projector is okaish.",2
Unhappy. Mezze platter had no taste and they took over 45 mins to prepare the food in spite of showing an expected delivery time of 30 mins. Not satisfied with service or taste. Thumbs down for me. üëé,0
"This one is near to paradise gachibowli. The ambience is decent and the service is fine. We tried the pepper chicken for starters and then for main course, we tried kolhapuri paneer with butter naan and tandoori roti. Pepper chicken but the quantity was too less for their price. Either the quantity or price could be changed. Main course was fine, especially butter naan was really nice.",1
"The lal street is awesome for food and beverages, one of the best place to hangout with friends the prices are decent so one can try here.
The dance floor is good and no restrictions for stages to dance on the floor.
THe waiters are too friendly they suggest better than any others bars.",2
Not as good as it used to be.Used to like pasta a lot but turned out to be a big downer this time with degraded quality. They definitely lost a repeat customer.,0
"It was my 4th order with Olive Garden in the last 6 months.  I loved the food from this place and this is the reason I ended up ordering from here multiple times.

This time it was a total disappointment in terms of the Veg Food and the service that was provided.

There was no difference in terms of taste and appearance for Veg Dum Biryani & Veg Pulao.  Both of these dishes were same I don't know how the restaurant makes that difference - still wondering.

In terms of the service, I ordered the food from Zomato at 8.00PM and the time of delivery was shown as 8.55PM.  I ordered it keeping in mind my meeting timing, however the restaurant was able to provide food to the delivery guy only at 9.30 which is like 35 mins late from the slated time.

I would still want to rate the food a 4 even after my bad exp with Biryani & Pualo.

Service wise I would rate this place a 2.5

The manager/executive from the restaurant to whom I spoke over the phone just kept saying one thing that sir we are working on your order and it will take 10 mins.",1
Went on a dry day. Still the service was good. The music and the dj is really good. We had fun. They have a fairly big dance floor which is a nice touch with cool graffiti.,2
I love Karachi for its taste. No issues with the food. But I ordered a pastry and asked it to be given as parcel. They just threw the pastry in the box and no spoon was given. However the pastry was awesome!!,0
"Have been here many times. I was a frequent at their madhapur branch since 2006. Its a quiet place and family friendly. The lift is old, dark and horrible. It feels it will breakdown, except that it doesn't. They tried installing another lift but that turned out to be scarier that the first one. Coming to the food. Its just okay. Nothing outstanding or too bad. Starters and Chicken items are usually good enough. Their tandoori chicken doesn't have breast portion. I couldn't understand the rationale behind it, its just leg, thigh and wings. And yes I don't know why they have downgraded their crockery. They serve curries in smaller household type steel bowls.",1
"Ordered chicken pizza , missal pav and cocktails. Missal pav was ok but the chicken pizza was just too good. Ambience is awesome and unique.",2
"I visited on 27th Nov morning around 11am to pick up a cake. The outlet was medium crowded. As I pick up my cake and go ahead for billing, I see only one out of three billing counters is operating. Although I was the second one in the cue but the family whose billing was under process had more than 4 basket filled with items which approx would have more than 40 items. In not less than 5 mins the cue extended till 5 people waiting for the billing. When asked to the manager, to operate other billing counters he replied ""WE DON'T HAVE MANPOWER"". Frustrated with the cue, we asked how can you just have manpower for one billing counter where you have machinery available for 3 he replied, ""WE DON'T HAVE MONEY TO HIRE""!
What an experience!",0
"We've been here on recommendation from my colleague that the starters are on fire since I am a big fan of starters.
So as soon as we reached the spot, we could see that the restaurant was congested and somehow they just wanted to fit in the Gachibowli area. The interior was also tiny and seemed confined.
Anyhow we ordered chicken garlic, chicken biryani as that was a very standard item to test on any new restaurant. The staff were ok, not quick but not rash though. Even though they got our food very late, they somehow tried to convince us with something non-relatable situations.
Forgetting all that, we just wanted to concentrate on our food. As soon as we had our first bite, the first thing that came to our mind was - it's good but not great. The flavour in the Biryani was good but the quantity was on a lesser side when compared to the prices.
Overall, it's a place where you can visit once in a while if you stay/work near Gachibowli. This is not a place to visit from a long distance.

Prices are high , can be lower ..taste can be improved alot",0

"New Entry in Zomato Gold-
Ambiance- 
Olive Garden is located at the Time Square, Indira Nagar beside Dominos Pizza. There is nothing much to say about the ambiance of Olive Garden Restaurant. This restaurant is very small, with no live screening and no music. Ambiance is quite boring, as they didn't even decorated it much. Even on the Saturday night, this place was not at all crowded.
Food-
We ordered Chicken Chatpati Kebab as a starter cost approximately INR 255. The quantity of Kebab was very less. They served Kebab with the green Pudina Chutney. Both the qauntity and the quality was not upto the expectations. Then we ordered Chicken Dum Biryani cost approximately INR 210.
This was the worst dum biryani I ever had, that I didn't even tasted like Biryani. Instead of Dum, they added so much oil in that Biryani. Olive Garden offers 1+1 dish on Zomato Gold membership.
Service-
Service here was too slow and the staff didn't even give attention.
Overall-
I don't recommend this restaurant to anybody, because of the bad experience I had here.",1

"One of the best bars I have visited in Hyderabad so far...It has a quirky concept of
BarExchange.

Its a great place to hangout and party with ur friends, has a groovy music and a big dance floor, it also has an option of open air and this place is crowded on weekends.
It's all based on the demand and supply that day!
A large dynamic trading display board tells you what the current price for various drinks is, and shows you the highest and lowest prices for the day, in real time. All you need to do is download their app, which also shows you the trading board, and use it to place your order.
The food is acceptably good and service is quick.",2

"I have ordered food couple of times from this place but never been there. Mostly I used to order thali for lunch. Which was worthy. This was my first physical visit to the restaurant. And I was very amazed to see all the glory around me. Ambience, look, coziness and lighting all were so perfect. The soft couches were so comfortable. Then moving to the food, I ordered chicken steak platter. This contained two portions chicken breast, mashed potato, stir fried veggies and rice. The quantity was enough to fill the belly. Further we ordered butter roti and lajeez paneer. Paneer was soft and dipped in delicious gravy. It was not spicy, not salty, with all balance flavours. In drinks I had virgin pina colada, well blended coconut cream and sweetness. I found this place very nice to hang out with friends. It is not family friendly. Staff is courteous. There are multiple options in food menu and bar menu as well. Also the walls have fantastic prints to compliment the overall ambience. Trust me you will never be disappointed after going to this place.

Ambience - 4.5 out of 5

Food - 4 out of 5 (cost could be lower side slightly)

Staff service - 5 out of 5",2
"the cake was spoilt, and both the restaurant and Zomato are not ready to refund the amount",0
gajar halwa was bad,1
Been here many time and really like the place for drinks and finger foods. Crowd generally come around 10pm. Dj is also nice. Bar tenders are really cool and friendly.One mushroom coated one I remember which I order every time. That beats the nonveg starters too.,2
They did not kept name on cake,0
sweet was not served with ordered veg executive meal box,1
Loved their dance floor and drinks menu. Would highly recommend the blue curacao for mocktails and their Cosmo for the cocktail. Their pasta is one of the best preparations in my opinion. Definitely recommend a revisit.,2
Too much cheese and also it smelled stale,0
"Order regular paneer tikka briyani from this place which costs rs 250/-. The briyani was good but the paneer was not so fresh and the quantity was very less. It just fills one person stomach, if someone's appetite is high then they would regret if they order food from this place.

There were two sizes, small (Rs:160/-) and regular (rs:250/-). Obviously one would think that small fills one person and regular would fill two. But No!

Very disappointed with the portion of food that they serve.

The Raitha was really tasty!! I hope they increase the portion for the amount they charge.",1
"Have been a number of times to the lal street .
I have loved the ambience here. The crowd was pretty good and had a great time. It would have been better If I would have got table , as I had made reservations. THE DJ was just fine and was playing too many old songs.",2

quantity and quality need to be improve,1
"It's a good place with bollywood /mix music.Good place for basic chill scenes with friends.it had a decent dance floor, good food and drinks",2
"Received pizza which was not baked properly,raw from inside instead of pasta which i ordered initially. Didn‚Äôt like the pizza at all. Why did they accept the order if they were running short of stock.",0
Food quality is too good. We have ordered fish tikka and paneer Mali tikka. Both of them were better than experience. Waiting time is too high. I felt the quantity is too less compared to the price.,1
"Went there on an IPL night. Music and ambience is nice. We ordered drinks and a couple of starters such as stuffed mushroom, chicken in black bean sauce, jalapeno poppers and a fish dish. All the dishes were good but the jalapeno poppers and stuffed mushroom were impressive. The service is slow though and ordering drinks on the app might become a challange at times. Overall a nice place to hangout.",2
Not nice,0
Ordered chicken tikka kebab and chicken butter masala.Packaging was nice.But taste was not great.Okayish.Butter masala was more sweet than spicy.Pocket friendly but definitely can be better.,1
A great party place and a decent size dance floor to try out all your new moves and get loose. The food is tasty and love the concept of ordering drinks via app as per drink exchange rate.,2
Food had no spices and salt,0
"The first time I ordered their Chicken Tikka Biryani, I became fan of it. Loved it so much that I recommended it to my friends and colleagues as well. The second time I ordered it, the quantity was very less compared to the first time and tasted different as well. I've got the same sort of feedback from friends also, that their food is inconsistent in taste, quantity and its a hit or miss. I would sincerely suggest them to be consistent in quality and quantity both as they've got good potential.",1
"Grate place for food lovers, the tempting and mouth watering dishes are speechless, loved the ambiance and the vibe of the place, surely recommended for its food and ambiance.",2
Cake was stale,0
too oily,1
"Good ambience, good food, good dance place.

Three of us girls went to this place on a rainy Friday evening and it turned out to be good fun. We ordered:

White sauce pasta: it was awesomely tasty. The sauce was made correctly with the right consistency. There were vegetables in it.

Nachos with sauce: again another yummy dish. Though the sauce was a bit less and it did not suffice until the end of Nachos, but overall the dish was delicious and worth it.

Chicken kebabs: just wow. The best dish of the evening for us. Soft, succulent with the right amount of spices and the gharwale taste jaisi dhaniya-pudina chutney made it worth the money.

We also ordered beer, virgin mojito (good) and a pineapple mocktail (very bad - pure waste of money).

It also has a good dance place. Furthermore, the dj was good and played an awesome list of bollywood numbers, to which we grooved until the end.

All in all, an awesome experience and I would have given 5 stars, but the pineapple mocktail and the seats that we got inspite of booking in advance made me deduct one star.",2
"we had big expectation but the experience was horrible, we got burnt pizza. we need refund, we didn't even eat the pizza, is there a way to attach pictures in feedback. please send me the email address where I can share the pictures of pizzas.",0
quantity is very less when compared to previous orders,1
"Ambiance, staff, environment was all set to peaks. Music was much much appreciated. I was been there on ladies night but that doesn‚Äôt stopped stags to get in and the crowd was amazing. Best bar stock exchange witnessed up to now. We had a very good day watching IPL match.",2

"Amazing place!
The ambience is good and the music is even great!
I‚Äôve been here thrice in the past three weeks and it turned out to be pretty amazing experience always.

Their exchange system of liquor pricing is quite good and affordable to most.
I‚Äôve even had Jameson for 140 bucks a peg! üòÖüòÖ
Their LIT is effective üòõ

I‚Äôve tried their chicken tikka biryani and hot Asian noodles!
Chicken tikka Biryani was amazing! I loved it! üòç

Will I visit this place again?: YES! YES! YES!

Btw: They have liquor at mrp on every Mondays!",2
"One of the worst services I would have ever come across. There were two incidents at the same cafe and the feedback given to them was not even reviewed.
The first time, I ordered an Irani Chai and it took them 1hour to serve and it was one first chais ever consumed. It was served in a broken glass. Very disappointed.

The second time, my female friend wanted to use the washroom but it was extremely dirty and smelling.


It‚Äôs sad to see such disappointment from a brand like Karachi.",0
"Biryani was bad, it was burned. Taste was bad.",1
The music was over the top and it has a decent dance floor. Food was good and this place accepts zomato gold 1+1 offer. As it‚Äôs a bar exchange you will get to enjoy drinks at lower cost as well üòâ,2
The food was okay. The ambience was good but the waiter's behavior was not good. A zomato guy came to receive an order he asked for a glass of water and they denied him and told him to wait outside.,0
Taste is good(chicken tikka biryani). As per the quantity not value for money,1
I can't tell you how awesome the food has been. I ordered Chinese Choupsey and Hot Asian noodles with a Roasted veg shack. Damn. I was shook at the quantity because it was a lot for 2 people. Absolutely Loveddddddd how it tasted! I cannot begin to explain the amazing taste of the saut√©ed and partially barbecued flavor of the vegetables. I'm a pure vegetarian and Lal exchange is now my fav place to eat now. üíú,2
Very bad service. I had to askfor a glass of water 5 times. One waiter passes the message to another and the other one doesn‚Äôt care!!!! Horrible service. I m never going back there.,0
One of the good places for students day out. With variety of dishes Delhi 39 is a value for money restaurant. Ambience is bit cozy but could be managed.,1
"Got a chance to visit this place with team. Such a superb place to Hangout. I recommend this place for parties,to watch cricket on big screen & have fun and best place to spend time with friends. The starters were too good, drinks are okay and biryani can be better...I know many people don't visit this place for biryani üòÖ

"Man! Who the hell are giving such high ratings to such useless cafes? Yesterday I went to one cafe seeing a 4+ zomato rating, and it was horrible. Today I went here and it even exceeded that other cafe today in terms of pure pathetic-ness of the cafe. The service is so rude, slow and pathetic that you wonder how bad would it be to make it self service. The food is bad and certainly not worth such high prices. And the guys are least bothered to tell you by the time that you ask for bill that one of the drinks you ordered isn't available; let alone bring drinks along with the food. I don't know how these inflated ratings in Hyderabad is working, but in my hometown, a place like this would hardly touch 2 stars rating on zomato.",0
"tawa Roti's are very good and like home made. I have ordered Kadhai paneer though there were only capsicum and onion with 2-3 very small pieces of paneer, taste was good.",1
A good place to hangout. They have indoor as well as outdoor seating. Live matches on big screens are quite engaging. Starters are appreciable specially Tandoori Malai brocolli.,2
"I had a really bad experience in Karachi cafe. I have visited this place with a lot of hope as the rating and the review are really good. Ordered only ginger tea, Irani tea, osmania biscuits but unfortunately we did not like anything they offered.

Even the tea was not good and the pricing is really high and I am not ok with paying rs. 75 for a bad cup of tea.

Sorry folks. You guys need to improve.",0
The taste is good....but very oily.,1
"Good ambience
Nice outdoor seating
Good dancefloor

Can visit for casual chilling",2
"The retro theme ambience was classic.
But I didnt like the food over there, it was average. I even ordered ferrero rocher shake and would rate it 2/5.",0
received only two rotis instead of three ordered,1
Nice place to hang out with your friends and family. Service is also very good. Best brewed beer in the city. A place with good ambience and good service. Must try,2
"I have ordered red velvet cake once. They asked to change the order as red velvet was not available. So, I asked the available list of cake and on that list I ordered chocolate cheesecake. After 50 min of waiting they again call me and told that cheesecake is not available. What kind of behavior is this. Never order from here",0
food was very oily and not much tasty,1

Very recommended place for #goout with buddies to have some special time.
I love the MRP night..üçª

Went there with a friend on a weekday evening. Ordered bbq chicken and nizami roll. The chicken in both dishes did not taste good and was not fresh. Irani chai was not up to the mark. Cost wise its on the higher side and not worth it. Overall a bad experience.,0
soup was normal,1
"This is one good pub that can make your evening.
Went for my birthday, the food is good and so are the drinks, made better by zomato 2+2.

The music was good and had a great time dancing to the numbers DJ was playing.

Overall you will be satisfied and would want to stay longer.",2
"Visited this place for an early lunch, as every other nearby place dint start serving.

Ambience looked classic with those vintage vibes.

Ordered penne in Alfredo sauce which took 40 mins for them to serve. It tasted average. It was loaded with way too much of cheese which I don't expect in pastas (I wouldn't mind that if it was a pizza though).",0
"Ordered a lot from this place and went for dine in a lot of times as well. The biggest issue with this place is lack of consistency. It is okay for the price range but the quality and taste of food will be a surprise almost every time.We usually have:
Mushroom Masala: Usually quite good with good amount of mushrooms.Garlic Naan: Nice and crispy.Mixed Raita: This has always been good.
In terms of ambience it has very less to offer and an okayish service.",1
"Have been to this place...

Ambience - took up the seat in the outdoor area... loved the place and the music beats....

Service - staff person was Santosh. He was very efficient and courteous.

Food - ordered white sauce pasta, misal pav, bombay sandwich and drinks.

Misal pav is great but a suggestion here. Increase the quantity of misal in the plate. The taste was real good.

Pasta was amazing. Loved the crunchiness of veggies.

Bombay sandwich - initially i was bit skeptical in my anticipation but the sandwich was exactly hiw it should be.. osum... green chutney turned its magic on..

Definitely must visit place..",2
Had cutlet.... was a big let down!! üëé can do better with the taste. Even the accompaniment is a normal store bought ketchup!!! Menu could be listed as ‚Äòbeet root ‚Äò cutlet instead of cutlet to prepare the mind.,0
"Taste is ok ok, but service is slow. Usually ordered online, quantity is moderate. Tandoori roti was not what we expected and panner dishes are sweeter",1
"I visited this place on last Saturday and I really enjoyed the evening. The best thing which I liked about the place was only groups and couples were allowed to enter the Dancing floor which does not happen in Delhi . I really liked the food and the crowd, would love to visit again .",2
"Went there with good expectations.. coz I have been here many tyms but felt of writing a review today coz food was baad.. mainly standards...Bun Maska in initial days it used be best but now I didn't find it great, but ok.. kheema pav was today best I can say.. had bheja n roti as well, it was well cooked but missed the actual flavours of the spices, I some how liked the Hyderabadi style but one can try Irani style here..I didn't like the Irani chai one can get a better chai outside small local cafes.. well maintained ambience.. overall it was average with taste n flavors.. may I need to try some more dishes....ü§ò",0
not bad...taste li'l more salty...other wise good.,1
"The place will never get bored as it has peachy music and the taste of the food was soo yummy.We tried the chicken wings they were fab!!The adornment is very classy in a lofty way.Overrall a very good place to hangout with friends.

Lassi was not that good,1
"This place is something you can never get bored off, groovy music, good food and crowd is also nice üòã . The lal street has a big dancing floor , ambiance is pretty good and has a outside seating area also. It's very crowded on weekends like anything

Talking about the food this place is Zomato Gold Food partner. If you have it , you can enjoy the benefits
- Chicken Lolipop, crispy lolipop served with salsa sauce
- Masala Papad , stuffed masala papad rolls with coriander chutney and onion
- cheesy pineapple sticks (Never ever order this, it was pathetic) :(
- Paneer lazeez , creamy tomato onion gravy with cottage cheese (highly recommended)
- Chicken Tikka Masala (highly recommended)
- Cheese Garlic naan and butter Naan

Overall my evening at Lal was just amazing, the service was really good. You can go with your friends and family to enjoy the weekends for sure. #mydj17",2
"The Chicken Kabiraji was too greasy, I cannot rinse off the oil.

The Famous Kolkata Style Fish Roll was tasteless and dry.
And to top it the delivery was not packed correctly, the yellow mustard sauce was spilled all over.",0

Amazing place on Weekends!! Must visit if you have crazy set of friends to dance with. I have been there several times and trust me it never disappoints me,2
"I've ordered their Keema Pav on Swiggy and I was very dissatisfied with it. The keema was stale and blubbery. Their is lot of fat and meat was very minimal. I couldn't finish even half of the portion served. And it was very clear that the dish/mutton is not fresh. Please check with them if you really wanna try this dish.
PS: It had a bad effect on my tummy as well.",0
too late to serve,1
I liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. The staff are friendly over all experience is ok. I liked the starters. It is ok with a group of 5 to be there,2
too much of salt n oil ....not even good quality of bread,0
"Visited this place at night. Had chicken Biryani, Fish Biryani, tandoori chicken as starter. Food taste wise was good. we choose In door A/C seating. Need to work on cleanliness which is lacking in this place.",1
"First of all special mention to Santosh who really made our evening very best by his great service. He was superb in taking our orders and serving really fast. Thank you Santosh for it.

Now coming to F&B, though little priced on high end, it was worth it. Every thing we ordered in Veg, Non Veg and Drinks (Mocktails) we're really good... Music was lovely, ambience was perfect and above all I believe Wednesday is Ladies Night... So all the girls / ladies you know one place to go as well, if you didn't know so far like me... :-)

Overall... Very well spent time and gathered loads of memories as always... Will go again for sure... Just waiting for a reason, if not will make one ... :-)",2
Delivery boy said that he met with an accident. Food got spill out of packed box,0
The mutton biryani and tandoori chicken is good. Rest of the dishes are as good as pakwaan or shah ghouse . Decent place to beat your biryani cravings.,1
"Even though this place is huge, we couldn't find a place to sit initially. Around 10.30 we finally got a place to sit. The food and the bar here is good and service was prompt (once you get a table). The DJ played some nice Bollywood songs. Overall it's a nice place but I'd recommend to book a table before you go here if you are planning to visit on weekends.",2
Ordered pasta and taste was not at all good,0
The biriyani was great. But ambience is not that great. Crowded mostof the time. Good for parcel of food. U must order the mutton Biryani here. Service is quick though.,1
Good place to hangout when you buddies and pals. Dj just turns on the dance floor. Place gets over crowded in weekends but the ambience makes you to stay and enjoy your drink.,2
the tea was just half cup!!!! for 55 rs half cup tea!! u r looting people here. will never order from here again. ginger tea doesn't taste like ginger its just sugarcane juice and that too when we asked for less sugar,0
This was ok but not tasty I have ordered chicken Biryani here it was ok we can taste it once or twice because some one like some thing it looks good,1
"What an ambience. It was a Saturday evening on which we visited this place.
It has got that stock market price fluctuation system for beverages. We could order ourselves from the app.

The Lal Street (to be read as Dalal street where the stock exchange is actually listed). 

In terms of food, we ordered two preparations,
Cheese Chilly Toast was well prepared but had a lot of chillies.
The Lal Special Pizza was not upto the mark. (coming from a reviewer from Kolkata)

If you hit the right price, alcohol can be really cheap. We ordered Black Dog Triple Gold Reserve for around 180 INR. 

It's definitely a bang on party place which requires a little improvement when it comes to food.",2
"I read about this place in best shawarmas listing in Google. And Ordered peri peri chicken shawarma. It's average because i regularly eat shah ghouse one's. For sure, shah ghouse is a lot better than this. And there is no reason to prefer this over that.

And for the coke drink they took 60rs for a 20rs bottle. Seriously?",0
"They have really good bryani and starters. Overall food quality is good. We did not find the Whole wheat roties they are of mostly maida. Staff is good, they will help you in choosing the menus recomendations etc. We always feel comfortable to seat in AC room rather outside. Parking available. Location is easily reachable. Many times they do not accept the card payment so make sure you carry cash or they have ICICI ATM in front of cash counter.",1
Awsme place for hangout wid frnds... And the joker poster was outstanding.. loved the place and service... The guy who served us also worked well...,2
Ordered for brownie which was completely dry and was not fresh at all. Choco banana Waffle was okay not so good. They send the food in big box which looks like will have good quantity. But will get a small piece and that is too tasteless,0
I ordered for full they delivered only half,1
"This place is like home. Hindi Dj songs will take u to next level. Croud is so decent nd friendly.
Food is awesome specially loaded French fries..",2
"No maple syrup with pancakes and waffles.
If no maple syrup is to be included in your combo please specify it but serving pancakes and waffles without syrup or anything else is simply not acceptable. This is the second time this has happened.",0
"Have been to this restaurant many times. Taste wise, preferably better than all other restaurants (next to Shah Ghouse, I would say). Quantity wise, one biriyani will be more than enough. Chicken Biriyani with double masala would be a treat to taste buds. Go for it. The chicken would be damn soft and good. Starters like Pepper Chicken, Chicken Tikka, Tandoori, all are good. They need to work more on ambiance as the place is not clean. Moderate pricing and enough number of items to go with.",1
"Good food options and decent service. Is expensive and dark ambience. During lunch time is not lively, though I expect evenings would be crowded.",2
"I ordered a green chicken rice bowl (large).it had less than 10gms of chicken forget about the box size ,shawarma would have had more quantity.I don't know what would I have got if I said small portion.Totally bad experience.",0
"Food is good, food delivery is too late by the the restaurant person. No fault by Zomato agent .",1
"Gives you the millennial pub vibe. Nice ambience and food. The stock exchange theme always gives you a different and fun feel. The crowd is also good. One star is deducted for the service department, which I felt needs some improvement.",2
"First Impressions: Not a place for breakfast for sure. They aren't ready for dine in customers.
Tells you blatantly that your order will take time (more than 40 mins before I placed the order). I checked in at 8 40 am!
Ambience is a great miss for sure. Super duper uncomfortable seats.
Add:
The pancakes are very average. Could be more fluffy.
They did not have waffles, so i can't tell.
Eggs: shambles not scrambled. Over salty in places. No salt in rest of the place. Why are you charging so much if you can mess up eggs.
Tea: the only reason I beimg kind and can say 2.5 is tea. Lovely tea. Quite a hassle btw for just tea though üòÇ",0
thank you,1
"The best thing about TLS is it's dj. Dj played a good collection of songs, it has a separate dance floor which is a major plus point. The ambience is good, food is above average and service is prompt.
A good place for sat nights..",2

"Ordered lollipop , got majestic delivered",1
"Visited here Saturday evening, place was full crowded and it took time to get a table though I've booked online. Drinks prices keeps changing here as stock market exchange prices which is speciality of the bar. Dance floor, ambience, music everything is so good here.",2
"I ordered garlic bread and cheesy fries with lots of hope since it had a 4.0 rating in zomato but sadly it disappointed me to the core , the garlic bread was as small as good day biscuits and very hard to bite while the cheesy fries were very cold and not at all consumable!",0
No quality in haleem,1
"The pricing here will be an interesting one to see! The higher the drinks get sold, the more the price is. Ambience looks decent and the dance floor is big.
Starters menu is good, we had cheese balls and chicken started. The pricing seems to be expensive on Starters compared to other similar restaurants.",2
"I've ordered chicken pizza squares (6pc). I waited for almost 20 mins. They served 6pc of sandwich bread topped with some chicken. I thought that they've served it by mistake. I asked the staff and they confirmed that the served thing is called ""Pizza"".
I wish the name in the menu is changed to something else.. or mentioning the recipe beside name could help in choosing the right food.",0
"The food is nice, tasty and generous in quality and quantity at a very reasonable price. The place is always crowded for this reason. Ambience is not that great and you can give it a try.",1
Been here on a Sunday afternoon. The place was quite empty as it was afternoon. The starters n drinks are quite expensive but Zomato gold is applicable so it became quite reasonable as we were only 2 people. The Ceaser salad here is the best I had in the city.,2
"A sincere request, don't try waffles from here. Tried a Nutella waffles priced at Rs 199 and they just put half a spoon of Nutella on three quarters of waffle. Expected a lot more, disappointed.",0
curd rice not good,1
Great ambience and their service was very good. Food was ok as I like less spicy and their food was very spicy. Liked that they too have bar exchange sort of thing. Enjoyed my visit. Must go atleast once.,2
They just cancelled the order after an hour. This was not at all justified and not at all accepted. Had a very bad first experience of the restaurant,0
overpriced,1
It was excellent experience spiced thank Krishna and monaj excellent food and service I am full happy enjoy the food and service thanks and team,2
Ordered peri peri fries online today . The fries were damp and cold. A suggestion to the restaurant to please not to accept orders if you cannot maintain quality,0
quality of food was poor. need to improve.,1

Krishna has taken care of us. And the chef pankaj has served all the special dishes to us. Will go again soonü§§ü§§ü§§",2
Kindly try putting more stuffing in the waffles.. we ordered two but it was all bread hence couldn't eat any.

"The place should be visited when only having good biryani is your priority and not the ambiance, hospitality or hygiene.

We visited the place with office colleagues for lunch. The food tastes average other than the Biryani which is simply awesome. We ordered tandoori chicken, chicken hariyali kabab, adarika chicken tikka, chicken & mutton biryani, double ka meetha. Had sweet paan in the end.",1

Great taste but not worth it! There is not place for dinning. Open all night! Fresh! Can come with friends but not dinning as said! Was full of cheese!,1

food was cool and waste of money late delivary,0
"Ordered from this place since I was on the lookout for a big fat juicy burger. They didn't disappoint. The Galaxy burger that I ordered was huge. The chicken was grilled properly and tasted fine as well. The only thing I didn't like (I'm a fussy eater) was that the chicken wasn't a breast piece or some sort of filet. It had some loose pieces of fat or skin (which I'm not fond of) and that kinda put me off. A pounded chicken breast without all those ""things"" in between holding the flesh, would have been better. Ultimately I took the burger apart and had the bread and chicken separately. Taste was good though. 
Still trying to find a burger that can satisfy me...",1
Very nice food and my family coming in restarent coming very nice sarvice very good food and very nice staters and mean course and staff is very nice sarvice and staff name Shekhar and santhu sarvice is very nice,2
"shawarma isn't actually a shawarma, it's more
like a frankie",0
"Have been hearing a lot about this amazing burger place opposite to DLF, what an amazing join with live grill and freshly made burgers, loved the friendly staff and a uniquely named menu.. ordered Galaxy and milky way burger which were amazing and cooked to perfection, the charcoal grill gives the burger a unique BBQ taste with chunky chicken pieces in it!!

On rush hours the service time can go lengthy, limit parking space the shop shares a juice center which is a plus point to grab some quick fresh juice or soft drink to go with your burger, and is open all night!!

Feels moderately over priced however considering it being surrounded by MNC""s and the taste maybe it's justified, and definitely it's a worth visiting place!",1
Very excellent sarvice very nice food and very nice staff very nice politley sarvice and srtaters very nice deserts very goood and very nice sarvice staff name shekhar and santhu sarvice nice,2
How can they not give my full delivery. You forgot to deliver my full order.,0
"I‚Äôve been to this place on my friends suggestion. Ordered one single chicken burger I don‚Äôt remember the name exactly. The chicken is grilled to perfection. Chicken piece is enormous than burger, infact when you bite the burger its not the burger which goes into your mouth its the chicken which goes into your mouth first. They‚Äôve also stuffed alot of cheese into it. Good taste for a street level burger place but there is definitely scope for an improvement.",1

"Ordered via Zomato. Poor packaging, the burger got squished. The chicken and sauces were quite tasty though.
The packaging should probably be in boxes.",1
"Very good and delicious food I have ever ate in Hyderabad.

@ Punkaj u have done a very good work and u r excellent in ur communication. Happy for it

Thank u
Sandeep",2
"So now this has left me with no option but to write a review after coordinating with the manager Mr. Rounaq Ali to get my 678 + taxes INR back for the incorrect billing. I made the payment for a total amount and when I got back home realised that the bar used my Zomato gold coupon but didn't apply to the final billing. Utter disappointment. They need to ensure that they don't do an incorrect billing as everyone has trust. Sorry to say it failed here.

Charging 110 for a sandwich and yet no brown bread,1
"Service was very good! And all the staff treated us very well especially @Bahadur was very attentive and happy to serve all out team! :)

Very good experience to have lunch with AB‚Äôs",2
"We were 5 friends and I specifically called to ask if stags are allowed. Manager told that stags are allowed. Once we reached, the bouncer refused us entry saying stags are not allowed on dance floor. I called manager again he also denied entry. I can't understand why can't they clarify the same on call. I spent so much money on cab only to be denied entry. La la Land sucks.",0
improve ur packing.... food never reaches hot,1
Awesome experience .taste was fantastic and service was wonderful giving by Nandan and Varun .those guys are very friendly and good manner .there way of talking very polite and courteous.,2
"Pathetic customer service. We called and enquired if stag entry was allowed and they said yes. Once we reached here, stag entry was not entertained. When we told we had already called before coming, they said we will allow stag but not dance floor. Why the hell you can't clarify all your nonsense rules over call",0
"this time, taste was good, but the bread became sogy with the mayo/cheese and started to break after few bites. I suppose that needs to be considered",1
We had Mr.Bahadur serving us. He was very courteous & service was top class. It was my bday & very impromptu . They brought in the cake & made my day even better. Taste was asusual excellent.,2
"The most horrible and disgusting place I have ever been to. They have a big menu to offer but most of it is not available to be served. The food is the shittiest thing ever made and eaten in human history. The waiters are rude and incompetent to either understand hindi or English. The acoustics in the karaoke nights sucks. When we asked for a manger, three different waiters came to us and finally when we said we won't pay the bill until the manager addresses our concerns is when the amazing pot bellied, arrogant and rude manager showed up. His name is Ali and he was in no mood to listen to any of the feedback we provided instead he offered as 2 free drinks which we definitely didn't need because somewhere he already agreed with the feedback we gave but he didn't want to do anything about it. When I tried explaining him that we would pay the bill, add tip and don't want free drinks but we want him to take the feedback seriously, he was like ""if u r leaving, leave, why are u wasting my time?"" I lost it and I was telling my friend, I repeat, I was talking to my friend stating ""what the fuck is wrong with this place"" is when he interrupts me and says that I need to mind my language. I was like, WHAT? ""I"" am talking to ""my friend"" about the ""place"" What's your problem in that? And I literally said sorry even, joined my hands for forgiveness to which he replies staying ""ye badtameez ladkia yaha aati he kyu hai, tmko jo karna hai karlo, ladkiya he ho na, kya ukhaadlogi, UKHAAD lo."" So that pretty much defines this place, the food and the people. Don't be a fool to visit this place even after reading my review. But yeah, if u think u can reach Ali a nice lesson, please go ahead, all my blessings are with you üòã",0
"Me & my friend we're looking for quick lunch on a Friday noon in Financial Dist and we spotted this place. Decided to venture as this will be our first visit.

It's was exactly at 12.30 noon when we entered restaurant and found there was hardly any one. Outside landscape, place for sitting is very good. There is in-house place with AC as well. We chose inside as it was already too hot. Ambience is descent and nothing very special, but is good.

Food we kept it simple as Nawabi Chicken Kebab which was special on the day we visited and Chicken Biryani. Kebabs were really nice. Biryani was like fine. Not so very delicious at same time it's not bad. Service is fast.

While if you ask me will you visit the place again, I might start thinking as I found place outside more interesting than the food. That does not serve purpose. So, I am sure you got answer.

Interesting was by time the clock ticked 12.45noon, my goodness entire place was filled with people and many we're waiting... That made us think, probably there is something else special about this place which we didn't order... So if at all I go there next time will see to it I taste it... üòÄ",1
"Visited with office friends. First things first, the staff was very polite and prompt. They kept asking what they should bring for us next and kept trying to over feed us üòÑ We even asked for a change of barbecue as it seemed one of them was not hot enough. The server tried to explain why too much heat is not good and might spoil/overcook the food, but on insisting, politely changed the barbecue.

Coming to the food:
Vegetarian had a variety of dishes from paneer , mushroom, crispy corn, potato etc. for starters. So, yes this place is good enough for vegetarians too.

Non- vegetarian starters had basic chicken (tandoori/leg), fish, prawns, mutton seek kabab (must try) Etc.

The main course, like any other buffet place was not that interesting. Noodles being one of my personal favourite, were a little disappointing.

The sweet section would make anyone happy. A thing to notice was that even though we stayed till the outlet was almost going to close, the sweet cornor was refilled on time.

Again kudos to the servers who made it a happy experience!!",2
The disgusting part is the manager Ali.Such a disgusting disrespecting person to his customers. Will never visit this place again. The problem is if the manager is so rude just imagine how rude the staff can be,0
"We always use to order their kodi pulav (which tastes sooo good few times and just okay some other times) on zomato but recently we visited this place to have dinner

So we ordered chicken manchow soup which was okay okay in taste cuz manchow noodles are not fresh since i could smell the oil in noodles... but quantity of chicken in soup was good !

Kothimeera kodi pulav (suggested by the server) is actually pretty tasty but i wish there was little more kothimeera in it ... taste was very good though..prices are little high",1
Had a very nice experience at abs gochibowli. Really they guys are very friendly and very polite. Mainly gobind and Manoj . Both guys are serve very well.,2
"We went for lunch buffet. 
Very limited options for starter - 3 non-veg(2 chicken and 1 fish) and 3 veg(2 potato and 1 paneer). they were serving the starter cold. The tawa fish was over spicy and they didn't prepare a lesser spicy version of that even after our request. Only chicken wings was good.

Main course was kind of good. Egg fried rice and veg noodles were good. Chicken biriyani was stale.

Dessert was good. Chocolate cake, gulaab jamoon and Ice cream were good. Semiya kheer was horrible.",0
"I have been here for a team lunch with my colleagues.The ambience is different one and very nice place to hangout with friends.The food they served had excess oil ,be it veg or non veg .if you are a spicy food lover ,then this will disappoint you.",1
"Excellent food and excellent service by bahadur we are fully happy to thus serve v also again visit soon love abs all items was excellent also,,,,,",2
"Well sometimes rating can be misleading. We visited the restaurant first time checking its online rating but found it too be much worst than one can imagine.
The Beer we selected from menu was not available so we decided to go for bucket of Corona bucket. Bucket beers are either served in ice bucket or at least bar tender ask customers to check it is chilled. Well here the good bar tender bought all six beers holding in his hand and was about to open it when we checked its temp. We were surprised to find it almost equal to room temp. And the irritating part was when the waiter behaved as if its too normal to serve such beer.

We asked for the best food they have and in next 10 mins we had Dragon chicken served. Eating it all I can say if it's ur best then your worst is not for humans.

Next we ordered crispy corn not to surprise us crispy part was completely missing and masala added on top of it was enough to burn ur taste bud.

All i can say if you know what a good food, ambiance and hang out place Never ever visit this place.",0
"This place is not exactly vegetarian-friendly. They cook everything in the same dish and I'm guessing they use the same oils. Did not eat here but thought people would like to know.
Service is quick for the starters. They took some time for the main course.
Friends say the food is alright.
There's outdoor and indoor seating. Place is clean throughout and it looks like the hygiene is good.
Gets really busy in the afternoon because it's so close to the IT hub.",1
Friendly people and enjoyed a lot. Nice food and good ambience. Bahadur rahman and vipal are superb and they served very well. We celebrated anniversary,2
"Very bad service and worst food they showing with coke but they didn't send taste is very bad.dont go this restaurant
Very very bad experience with this restaurant",0
"Pretty good ambiance. Very spacious and huge one.

Food is amazing except the oil quantity that they use. Prawns dishes were not that great. Only prawns starter i.e golden prawns were good.

Gongura chicken is amazing.

Service is very fast.

Would not recommend lassi at this place as its not the proper one. It's very watery and tasteless.

Management is pretty cool and open to feedback...they humbly accepted the fault in dishes and replaced them.

Can be improved a lot. Would surely pay a visit again.",1
"Amazing place to be. Excellent place

"We wen
t for lunch ala carta today ordered couple of non-veg starters and veg starters, all of them are salty and uncooked. The quality is also not fresh, they are smelly. The chicken sheekh kebab is full of dough and no chicken in it.

The main course is also awful and the chicken dum biryani is not actually dum biryani it is pulao.

Please avoid this place

The star ratings are fake",0
seemed like the biryani was over cooked,1
"Nice place. @shivam was nice and polite and served good food. Place is usually crowded, but prior booking. Can save you. Food was good. Overall good experience.",2
"This is my regular hangout place with my office buddies. The food was good thats the only reason for these 2 stars. But this review I'm writing is after a worst experience in this place. Last friday we have been to this place and we were looking at menu. my friend asked for a drink but floor manager said they don't have that brand. Then he asked for another brand again same reply. Then we looked at food menu and ordered chicken lolly pop then floor manager angrily said this is not local bar to ask everything whatever u eat outside. Then we literally got angry and said this is in your menu that's the only reason we are asking for it. Then he kept mum. We were literally pissed off by that floor manager behaviour and decided not to visit that place again.
Management need to take action against that floor manager or else they will lose some more regular visitors in future.",0
quantity less,1
Place is very nice and good is very good... people are also too glfriendly and nice. Service was really amazing thank you very much shivam thanks for your Service,2
"This ppl were very irresponsible. There swiping machine was not working.
But still they have asked us to enter pin for almost 3-4 times
I have shown a person there that the money was deducted but still he was not agreeing and asked us to do again..
Nd said if it happens the money will be returned back in 24hrs
But actually very disappointing is
We went there on Feb 23rd btw 7 to 8: 15
We got a email that there

Today on Feb 24th at 10am 11: 03am the money was again deducted..
Am asking you very politely if you return them back it's okay..

Excellent food and excellent service by Krishna and shivam Osama every ambience was really very good this is my 1st time I really like it thank you very much,2
"Food-5/10
Ambience -5.5/10
Staff-0/10
Music -2/10
Food quantity is less compared to other places . If you are going after 8:00PM there are chances that food will be served cold to you.
Not suitable for couples or a group of ladies . Only a place for boys to hangout.
The only best part about this is that you have a dedicated smoking room.",0
"Restaurant Food Ambience weather was sexy it was drizzling when I visited Drizzle made more exciting ü§©üòç All Were Good Except Staff I almost waited 30 mins for Food

"One of the best restaurants of Abs

Very very delicious food starters was simple awesome

Service was fantastic this guy's was very quickly
Ambience was also very nice
Dessert was excellent
Wish grill was good

"The food's really below average. Although they've put a lot of items on their menu, all of them lack quality and flavour. The service is not at all good. Nobody's even around you to take your orders or your feedbacks. If you are planning to go to this place for food, it's really a horrible idea.üëéüëéüëé",0
"Ordered a nice dinner for two from T Grill. The prices are mediocre and I placed my order late night via Uber Eats. Following is my experience-:

Service- The parcel came in around 10 minutes later than estimated. The delivery boy called once he was outside our society. 3/5

Presentation/Packaging- It was a usual packing. Nothing extraordinary nor anything bad about it. 3/5

Food- Food was fine but what really killed my appetite for it was the amount of chillies added. We tried the following-:

Paneer Pulao- It had a nice quantity, sufficient for two. There were average number of paneer pieces. It tasted quite yum. The masala was ample inside. Too spicy which killed it's essence. 3.5/5

Gobi 65- A good quantity for two, it tasted like a typical fried Gobi. Nothing extraordinary, the usual. 3/5

Will I order from here again? I will only if they decrease the spice level. Despite mentioning it clearly as an extra special instruction, it was supremely spicy which made me fill my stomach with water.",1
"Service was extremely good and the food was also better than any other barbecues.
Ali and mantu serviceboys were really good. They were patient and served us well.",2
"We went today for an office team lunch. We were around 25 in number and had made prior reservation. Reached there at sharp 12:30 .We had to ask the manager to get all the seats as he allotted seats to some other customers despite of our reservations. The first started was served 1/2 hr after we were all seated. One plate of starter served by one person to 25 people. I had to ask the manager to add few more people to serve but he refused. 
After the first serving of 1 veg starter we waited for another 20 mins. 
My colleague asked the manager if more veg starters will be served, and this was his answer.
""Abhi aap ne kya khaya ??.. Panner khaya na.... woh veg hi hota"".
We were shocked to see such a response and rude behavior from him.
The staff serving the food were courteous, but this guy who I think was the manager was extremely rude. I finally had to getup and make him realize of his behavior.  
Starters and food was ok for the price.",0
Average food had.... Here.... Only the part is price reasonable... But did not liked the taste of food .. had chicken biryani and other starters...which not like last time visit ... .......,1
"It was a great experience. Staff was really friendly,customer-centric and brisk service was provided. Ali and Matmtu were particularly caring. Had just the most amazing experience visiting here for the second time.",2
"This used to be a good place, the service level now is pathetic. They won‚Äôt even offer you the menu unless you ask for it, if a dish is served in a bad state it will take ages for you to give the feedback and by the time it is changed your meal would be over and the check ofcourse will take atleast 15 mins to get to you...so plan wisely at Lol Lol land",0
The food quality is not that greay but a good place to go and hangout with friends. They have a good area for kids to play. The food can be improved and the service needs to be improved.,1
"Nice food and nice service. Ambiance is also great. We wonder how you people manage all good food with good service. Great job. Keep it up. I liked all kind of non veg and veg crispy corns, that is my favourite.Special thanks to Ali and Mantu thanks for your good service for us.",2
"We went here for 31st 2018 Evening after reserving table for 3. They told us there will be 500 entry charge per person but that wont be a coupon inside to get anything. So it was 1500 for us 3 and food & drinks charges being seperate. We saw the menu rates online and felt it to be fine.
When we went there, for entry as they told 1500 we had to pay and that too they said they will only take cash 1500. Cards will be accepted inside but not accepted to take it for entry fee.
We always keep cards mostly, luckily we had that much cash, paid and went inside.
Got a table for 4 for us 3.
So like first mistake of staff when ordered a Mojito- Mocktail as I dont drink, and they instead of Mocktail send a Cocktail - Alcoholic Drink.
Second mistake of staff, as we are purely vegetarians- in beginning itself we mentioned that and ordered a paneer starter and some crispy potato starter. And they came and served Non Veg starter.
After complaining about this both to staff, they apologised and said it won't repeat.
Now when we repeated our starter and ordered crispy potato again, AGAIN for the 3rd time they sent incorrect order and a Non Veg Starter again to us.
I complained to Manager and he said sorry and staff said sorry but they didnt even had courtesy to make it up to their 3 huge mistakes back to back by any discounts which they could do LEAST.
Not that I asked for any but that was courtesy on their side.
So when all this wrong orders were going on in between of that we were asked to adjust on the seat of 2 and they made other people sit on our table across us even after reserving table and paying for it.
Ok and the last thing, the DJ mostly 70% of time was playing VERY OLD SONGS which I again didn't enjoy.
Oh yes and forgot to mention that they had increased prices on drinks and all food and had a whole seperate new menu for 31st December 2018 with increased prices.",0
"On the way back home from Mrugavani National Park, had a stop here for lunch. I really felt the present state of this place like lot of things gone missing. First impression, no one at the parking to guide or coordinate it, all were parked zigzag, welcomed by foul odour at that point.
Huge place, but no one seem to let us know of how to proceed further, like where to sit or dine, especially if it was first time like me. Initially noticed an outdoor seating, organized perfectly under hut shape units spread across the whole area with vibrant chairs and tables. Felt like scorching sun breeze wouldn't make us withstand it for quite long and so thought not an good idea to have lunch outdoors, also felt kitchen exhaust smoke widespread. No one cared to guide until I personally asked of any indoor is available.
So shifted to inside dining room, great relief finding at a corner a place for us. Our order was Veg platter - not worth price, taste, quantity. Jumbo chicken Biryani - evenly cooked, tender chicken, not so flavorful, Mutton Biryani is good.
Service lag, may be of huge rush. Missing fine dine features, asked for finger bowl but got an answer to wash hands outside.
Village back drop artifact, greenery are little bit saviors. May be at evening hours, outdoor seating could be good choice. Anyway no thrill at T grill.",1
"Ali , Mantu and arphan... served as awesome.. had excellent food... fish item and had a special veg manchuria item .. specially prepared for us.. deserts and cakes ...
...complimentary cake for special had is amazing.. thanks..",2
"We went for lunch buffet. Food taste is average and limited options. Service is really bad. None of them show up when we are asking for food, water etc. But we got the bill on our table while we are still having deserts.",0
"A different kind of taste for chicken lovers,veg is not that good,one time visit is not bad idea and it has huge open space for dining and staff is also co operative.",1
Visited ABs Gachibowli... Bbq was top class and especially live counters.. I must say abt deserts as well.. All are not just good toooo good... And I felt home with the hospitality of Ali and Manto was excellent.,2
The worse service. Food is worst and can't able to eat deserts. They can't even take care of customer. The fish starter was even very less items and less spacious.,0
"Located near Varun motors,
Been to this pace for lunch,
Place is huge with good outdoor seating.
Ordered chicken corn soup, boneless chicken kebab, chicken and mutton biryanis.
Chicken corn soup is ok.
Chicken kebab, soft and tender, tastes good, which is worth a try.
Mutton biryani is ok.

Cons : no proper service and waiting time is more.

Overall ok.",1
"Excellent serving and food is awesome, Ali and Monto‚Äôs service is awesome, food is too good, and the service from them is very nice, they are like family.",2
"Good for drinks ,not for buffet .

Not recommendable",0
"So it‚Äôs 11:30 on a Friday night, most of the restaurants are closed and we are hungry. We find this restaurant still delivering with ratings more than four. We order Veg Steamed Momos and Chicken Steamed Momos. We get the delivery on time and the food is not bad. Schezwan Sauce is steamy hot and delicious; but both the Momos on the drier side. Hence going with 3/5 for this restaurant.",1
Excellent food and excellent service by Krishna I am full happy with the food and service I like the most live contar thanks you guys thanked for the hospital,2
"The worst food I ever had .
Starters and main course is so worst to taste and you can eat julabjamun pieces by searching them in the water..",0
"Paneer fried momo was yummy. Thank you, the Mayo and sauce was good. Momos could be more softer, fried was too crispy. Taste could also improve much more.",1
Food was excellent. Servers were friendly and helping us all the time. Especially Krishna was very friendly and took care of us very well. I am planning to visit again soon and enjoy the food and hospitality.,2
"They don't seem to use good quality ingredients for the food they serve.
Went for vegetarian buffet.
Lot of variety to try on. Starters were decent , same for the main course but the desserts were horrible.",0
I had ordered veg friend momos and the Momo had no filling in it .. giving 3 starts because of last time's decent experience. Please take care while packing the food.,1
Very excellent food and nice place to have dinner . Situ and Shantanu helped well to choose best dishes and attended very politely. Prawns is a must try.,2

Very spicy food. Even the soup was ultra spicy. Starters were average. Main course could have more variety and some taste. Even the desserts were not good.,0
taste was good. but you provided only one mayo packet and 2 chilli sauce for 3 momo orders. and the ones provided dripped onto the package because of loose package,1

The music is so loud. We have requested them many times to reduce the sound. But our voice wasn't heard. We couldn't talk to each other. Never going to visit the place.,0
"Didn't really enjoy much here. Its a dessert place, so you go with a mindset to increase some kilos. But the desserts were not so good. The ambience quiet dull and boring. Haven't gone there since",1
The food was good. Lots of option in non veg ... highlight were the chaat items and pasta... service was good too... though veg options can be more .. also due to the heat it gets a little suffocating bcos of the heat from the grill....,2

"Not worth for money, ordered french fries and chocolate milkshake...waited for so much time after ordering, waiter forgot about the order and came again for taking the order.",1
Excellent service.. Maintain the same. caring the customers needs staff and maintains was good enjoyed lot food and ice cream and infrastructure,2
Just now had a buffet lunch and right now in restaurant only and writing this review. Not much option for vegetarians.

Dessert were not at all good in quality.,0
"Place have good ambience.
Gold benefits are eligible even on shakes.
We ordered shakes on sunny day.

Don't encourage such restaurants where customers are not treated well and food is as bad as it gets",0
"This is a good place to hangout, as they wont kick you out no matter how long you stay. The playlists played are really good.

The worst ever experience which I have ever faced.....
Zero taste, zero service, NO ac nor fan, the staff has no basic respect nor they are worried about the customer.

The Restaurant manager Mr. Anwar was rude towards customers don't know why they are running this hotel.

Completely ZERO.",0
"Have been to The Chocolate Room at other locations so visit to this one was quite awaiting. Like the ambiance and the aroma of hot chocolate that fills the restaurant. A good place to date. Definitely a little heavy on the pocket. Staff is friendly. 
We ordered:

‚Ä¢ Chicken cheese sandwich

‚Ä¢ Chocolate walnut sundae

‚Ä¢ Hot Hazelnut

The staff needs to focus on hygiene, there were cockroaches around the billing counter which was really disappointing; we pointed the same to the staff. The washroom was bad, no tissues or hand-wash. ‚òπ",1

"Had very good time, food is excellent and the ambience too.. Rehmat's service is excellent. Mexican fried ice cream is a must try.. Starters are good.",2
"Today I have received worst biryani, getting some smell, previously I have ordered so many times then it was good, today I don't know what happened",0
"Sinful. Nothing describes this place better. üò¨

Going through their super extensive menu would probably make you tired, but the service is so appalling, probably you‚Äôll die of hunger waiting for your order to arrive. The place is cosy enough for you to carry a laptop and spend a couple hours on an assignment. I‚Äôd recommend you do that cause anyway, they deliver orders after forever. üôà

As the name goes, I‚Äôve always had it in my mind to relate this place to a dessert bar. And hence, I‚Äôve never tried the savoury items offered here. But I‚Äôve heard they have a good offering among sandwiches and nachos. So that would keep my review limited only to the sweet dishes. üôÇ

The Toblerone Shake and the Kitkat Shake are the shizzz. So full of the taste- actually well prepared. The chocolate brownie is really a waste of money: you‚Äôve probably had much better brownies all over Hyderabad. üòù

Nutella Waffles and Death by Chocolate pancakes: so good ! A heaven full of chocolate sauce and ice cream. Make sure to hit the gym soon after :P

Slightly higher on the price point, but worth a try! üòÄ",1
"A fine dine place with variety of cuisine available to try on
Usually the starters are so delicious , we get tummyfull with that only , still we hop on to the meal :D
Also good liquors available. With good crowd
The one thing to be work on is the heat.
As there are grills on evry table and giant grill in the pantry, the temperature should be regulated or get little more cold to balance thr heat of grill.
I was having tissue papers and handkerchief in my second hand while enjoying the food.",2
Food is not good it's below average and too costly ... Moreover their behavior is not polite..... Restaurant is not hygiene as well ... The smell is bad ‚òπÔ∏è . When you are into food business have some respect for customers,0

"Great ambience and the staff was very responsive and friendly (sittu , santunu and badal). A must visit place for food lovers. If u are looking for buffet, this is the best place to try it.",2
"The waiters are super slow, the cutlery used in the restaurant are not even clean. Hygiene is a big issue here. Coming to the food, it's nothing extraordinary except the fact that the taste is close to home made food. But again, the usage of oil is much more. Biryani and tandoori are the safest options here. Keep a track of what you are ordering because the bill might not come right. Check it before paying. I found a dish added in the bill which I did not order. When pointed out, the waiter seemed to be confused.

This place, if it has a target of surviving,needs to improve a lot in terms of food taste, consistency, service and most importantly, hygiene.",0

At the time of serving food the waiter told us paneer is there but paneer tikka is not available and the hilarious part was we did not order paneer tikka, so what we ordered in veg in that also it did not had paneer. At the time of billing they create a lot of chaos...
So I had the worst experience.",0
"Ordered Paneer Tikka and Garden Fresh Sandwich with Oreo shake. 
Paneer Tikka - 5/5
Garden Fresh - 5/5
Oreo Shake - 4/5 ( As it was not so cold )
Staff : 1/5 If you request them some changes they would behave like kids and are not flexible at all, removing a topping would not cost them anything but they deny to do so. Something which is terrible out there.

Overall the ambiance was not so good. Ac was not working properly and it was a bit dull out there.

"Place located just opposite of DLF gate no 3, which is very much easy to reach. Just reached this place to explore some of their expertise dishes and found lost !
Food quality and staff slowness made me horrible.
Seems they have done some renovation recently, which give something new and good feeling. But to be honest, in a restaurant people visit for good food followed by service. And if this is not maintained then there is no meaning ..!

The Gachhibowli Chocolate Room is a nice place.I thoroughly enjoyed the delicious food on all of my three visits so far.However the quantity as shown in the menu is never the same on ur plate.Expect always a half filled stomach once u return back after spending comparatively a higher amount than any other meeting points like CCD.,1

I've ordered from this place a couple of times and I loved the burger and fries. But last night the burger I got was undercooked and reeked of vegetable oil. It was completely inedible.

"Visited Arena 11 for a Sunday Branch. It was Easter Sunday and the place was packed. Also, since the IPL season is on, this sports themed restaurant was on our visit list.

The have Sunday Buffet Brunch and the menu is very compact but most of the items in buffet were delicious. Though the presentation can be improved alot.

We also tasted their ala carte menu, a few of the items were good but their isn't much consistency with their dishes.

At once it will be amazing but the other time it can be below par.

Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka, Honey Chilli Chicken Wings and Tangri Kebab were served.

The Lemon Fish Tikka and Tangdi Kebab were good but Honey Chilli Chicken Wings were too sweet for my palate.

The Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries were good.

In buffet, the Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani stood out.

Also gajar ka halwa in desserts was great.

I suggest them to add some more variety for desserts",1

"It's during this time of the year where the cricket fanactics are on a lookout for places offering sports screenings and feel almost heartbroken not to find any dedicated sports bar in town. But not to worry as Arena Eleven's here to woo the same crowd, with their delightful sports-themed decor offering big-screen match telecasts for sports and all that coming with a beautiful rooftop ambience. Located at Level 4 of SLN Terminus Mall in Gachibowli, the tagline for the place is ""Kebabs, Beers & Sports"" each of which is incorporated in the menu as well as the setting quite aptly.

The menu for the place is particularly compact, serving only a selective few Indian and Oriental preparations both in vegetarian as well as non vegetarian diets. Sampling their vegetarian appetizer from the a'la carte section, we ended up calling for their Sizzling Veg Tikka Platter and Masala Fries both of which turned out to be pretty good. The platter came with 3 different tikkas of our choice, namely Veg Shami, Peri Peri and Lemon Pepper Paneer Tikka on a sizzling hot plate with onions on the base. Veg Shami was something that was absolutely mindblowing with a hint of heat both from chili and pepper with the perfectly soft texture. Masala Fries was just a Indianized version of loaded fries with the crisp potatoes sauted in with onions, ginger and garlic which worked as a good accompaniment for the drinks.

Non vegetarian section had some really nice dishes including the Tangri Kebab, Lemon Pepper Fish Tikka and Honey Chili Chicken Wings which were just perfect for a setting of this kind. My personal favourite was their Lemon Pepper Fish however, for the juicy and succulent fish chunks giving that lipsmacking balance of citrus and heat from the lemon juice and black pepper marination. Honey Chili Wings too were pretty good as a finger food having crispy fried wings tossed in a sticky sweet honey chili sauce, probably the best candidate to be had along with a couple of chilled beers. Disappointing was their Chili Fish however which had no flavour whatsoever - bland pieces of fish with the coating sauce containing just chili without any seasoning. The kitchen should probably revisit the recipe and take care in seasoning the fried fish with some salt and pepper.

Running a buffet on weekends, the place offers a beautiful selection of mains to the diners having a variety of Indian options to choose from. Each of the diets had two curries on offer with a choice of breads and rice, where the non vegetarian sect had Chicken Curry and Murg Makhani along with some delectable Chicken Tikka Biryani. After the disappointment in the starters, it almost came as a surprise how good both the mains were. Chicken Curry had the home style onion base with juicy boneless chicken bites added, going absolutely well with some hot Tandoori Rotis. Same was the case with Murg Makhani as well however it had a bit too much of sweetness for my taste. Trying out their Chicken Tikka Pizza from the a'la carte section turned out to be a disaster as the puffy base seemed to be store bought and stale, which definitely didn't justify the price tag for the same. The dessert options too gave little to choose from where we went for the Gajar ka Halwa and Rice Kheer both of which were plain simple average.

The service too wasn't any exemplary as the staff almost at all times paid no heed to the diners calling them out for help. Getting even a glass of water turned out to be a huge task, however on multiple complaints the restaurant manager did mend things well. The kitchen deserves appreciation for sending out dishes fast into the dining room however in the pace, they almost always lacked consistency. The dishes we ordered at the start of the meal when again called, brought something entirely different and dreadful on a plate. All in all, if the place provides a run-of-the-mill menu with a some good dishes but lacking the consistency to deliver entirely.

"It looks like a sports bar with proper setup. But the people around did not seem to be sportive, especially on a Friday night :P. Service was a bit on the slower side. Ambiance was good. Now coming to the main part, the food.

Sizzling non-veg Tikka Platter with 3 tikkas of your choice.
Jamaica Chicken Tikka - the best of the lot and a must try.
Nasheman Chicken Tikka - not so appealing but ok ok types taste.
Malai fish tikka - soft and tasty
Bhuna Chicken - one of the best I have ever had especially the fried onions on the top makes it so delicious, so this is a must try
Chicken Rajiala - A green gravy with boneless chicken, not so tasty
Chicken Hakka Noodles - It was too good especially for Chinese lovers
Sizzling Chicken Tikka Biryani - look wise it was actually sizzling, but not so much taste wise. Chicken pieces were a bit hard and rice undercooked.
Ginger Coke - Please do not try this one, as it was too costly and not at all a worthy drink

Overall was a good experience.",1
"Nice food options in starters, main course and sweet dishes. Our host Ali made sure that we were treated really well. Any changes required were immediately accommodated.",2

"Though this food chain has got some fame, I totally disagree with it for the experience we had on our Friday lunch. Poor response and tardy service. Management failed to take care of the waiters who were very few around the tables. Waiters has to be augmented along with swiftly handling the services.",0
Food and service needs to be improved. Chinese starters are fine. Pizza crust was very hard. Mocktails were not good. Iced tea had a very strong flavour of tea.,1
Shantanu Ali and team given me a great experience for my 1st time experience in AB's. I suggest my friends to visit and I refer you all who read this approach them for your great experience.,2
The worst experience ever. Ordered achari ghoshti it came with more salt later asked him he repaired the remaining curry after half an hour. Also the service was too slow and pathetic.,0
"Experience at Arena Eleven... Since it‚Äôs in SLN Terminus mall it‚Äôs not very difficult to find. It was a Friday when we had dinner here and the experience it wasn‚Äôt the best, although it could be! Place was packed by 9-9:30 pm. Definitely this place has the potential to improve and become better. One big minus point is that on a Friday evening the washroom was out of order and I had to cross all SLN third floor to get to the toilet. Ups, that‚Äôs really bad!

Ambiance is vibrant, atmosphere is good but the music is too loud! Usually I don‚Äôt mind the music but here was really difficult to have a conversation. They have screens and it‚Äôs a good place to watch some sports. There is some kind of terrace too and that‚Äôs good till the hot summer.

Service was good regarding the waiters but really slow in bringing the food out from the kitchen. They also have to change their menus or something because many items we tried to order weren‚Äôt available (like burgers, pizza, etc). On a Friday evening pizza and burgers definitely will be ordered!

When it comes to the food we had enjoyed thoroughly some items but others were just average. We had sizzling kebab platter. Chipotle and jamaican chicken and lemon and pepper fish we choose. Awesome kebabs!! Really juicy and tasty every each one of them. We had sizzling mint biryani which also was delicious. They didn‚Äôt give any mirch ka salaan, raitha or onion with the biryani, just plain but I asked for some raitha and they brought. Rice was flavoured and chicken was tender but just 4 small pieces. The let down were the rolls. We had 4 different types of rolls with fries and wedges. Maximum average on quality and taste.
The price is on the expensive side but it still worth a try, at least for the kebabs!

Overall a good place for hanging out during cricket and football matches cause of the ambiance. The food is good as well. We had the kebab platter which was delicious. The masala French fries were hot and crispy. The egg noodles were a good option for the main course. The chicken tikka biryani was disappointing though. The Air conditioner was not open at 4 30 in the afternoon which made it a humid experience.,1

Ulavacharu is well known for its taste. But the service I received today was the worst and this is not the first time even after complaining to the manager about it he did not even apologize for it and moreover he delivered me mutton instead of chicken and when asked about it he was like this is chicken and he tried blaming me instead . The way they behaved was worst . Manager named veera babu was very rude too. He was not even responding whatever we ask he said I am the sole owner and no one is above me. Even after we paid the bill they behaved rude. I do not recommend going here..,0

"Very bad experience with this place. Ordered lemon corriender soup with godavari royyala vepudu. soup is good in consistency but high on sourness. Not really good. Royyala vepudu was good but not hot, looks like they prepared an hour ago. After that we ordered gadwal Kodi pulao which is my worst experience ever. It is an highly spiced rice which a normal person can't eat.
Ambience and service is very good but not the food",0
"Sunday brunch experience at Cascade-Radisson. It was a mixed experience because they had things we loved but also things we hated, I‚Äôll describe in the review.

Service was really good, one of the best. Mr. Salim and staff really did a great job to host us. Plus point for them!

Ambiance instead was a total let down, at least for us. Floor was dirty (as you can see in some pics), chairs were dirty, even the water bottle was dirty. The restaurant itself has nothing special, no atmosphere... just bland. If you want to go and have a good time and to enjoy the atmosphere this is a NO NO!

Food was on the good side. It had good spread and some really good items as fish in butter sauce or polenta with mushroom ragou. Starters were average as desserts. The best part on desserts was the fresh made waffles. All other items are usually like everywhere, salad counter, pizza and pasta counter etc. With some small exceptions has nothing special on menu but not bad on taste.

When it comes to the price for the buffet I think is too expensive. Most of the times we go out with some kind of discounts or coupons but at full price definitely not worth it!

I have been this on last Sunday . I booked from dinout .i was expecting a lot fr this place scene it is a five stars hotel but i didn't feel that much good . Quality of food is ok i can say as per my experience ... Specially if you are a vegetarian then it not a good place for you ....,1
Very nice food and excellent service and hospitality specially by Rehmat. The grills and deserts were excellent specially pan ice cream.....,2
"The place doesn't serve your booking request. You have to still wait an hour to get the table even after doing a booking, it just completely spoils the mood .",0
We went for the buffet dinner at Radisson with team. The overall dining experience was average. Food was decent nothing great or worth mentioning. Dessert section was elaborate while the main course seemed a little disappointing.,1
"Excellent food and excellent service providing by Mr bahadur vrahamat and ripen we are fully happy there service also again visit soon love and ,,,,,,,,,,,",2
"Food isn't great for the price. Ulavacharu Veg Pulao or Ulavacharu by itself wasn't to the taste.
Not a great place for Vegetarians. Heard good about Non Veg options.",0
"We went for the buffet lunch at Radisson after a few years. The overall experience was very average. There were events going on and the place was overcrowded. Very few staff to help/assist.
Coming to food, some items on the buffet were decent. The basics liike Paneer curry, lacha paratha etc were good.
Salads and chaats were OK.
Desserts were below average.
The one thing that is usually safe is a pizza. They had pasta and pizzas as part of the buffet. Unfortunately they couldn't get the pizza to taste decent. I had to leave pizza and eat something else, which I never do.
Poor experience overall and unlikely to return again.",1
"Been to this place for the first time.
Absolutely loved the experience and service.
Would come back here again everytime I visit Hyderabad. A must try!",2
"It's worst place to dine

Too much hyped!!!!!!!!!

Last Sunday we visit this with my friends.. I tried here bamboo Chicken n pachi Mirchi kodi pulav both not at all up to the Mark",0
"This seemed to me as mainly buffet focussed - breakfast, lunch and dinner - staying guests being the main clientele. I‚Äôve had a few meals here and couldn‚Äôt complain. Standard fare with many options laid out which probably won‚Äôt wow you, but you‚Äôll find a few things that you‚Äôll like.

Their service is really good and I find the ambience very relaxed. The a la carte section is quite limited and basic but they do make a pretty mean grilled fish dish.",1
I love the food and service mr chef Pankaj and bhadur give excellent excprince today I like the most crispy corn and chef special mutone and paan shot ice cream üëåüëçüëåüëåüëå,2
"Was there for new years eve, the ambiance is great and so was the staff but it was overpriced by almost 50% and Mutton wasn't cooked well.

Fish vepudu though was finger licking good.

Would have been 3 stars but reduced two because of pricing and poor Mutton dish.",0
"Cascade is a luxury dining restaurant that falls under the notorious Carlson Group of Hotels and offers multi-cuisine dishes.

The tremendous ambiance fully complements the canons of the place and instantly lightens up your mood into musical. An addition to the offering is an elaborate buffet for foodies. Cascade is in Gachibowli main road.

It‚Äôs located on the second floor of the property. While the lobby is inviting, it only dispels all the doubts about the food being as inviting as the lobby. As you enter Cascade, you are greeted by a Buddha Statue.

As soon as you enter their food counter spread all over at the corner side. we had a few veg and non -veg salad, sausage with spinach. Started picking one of one and observed fish was stale and seems It was reused. The chicken was hard and sausage was almost beginning to wring itself.

Actually, none of the salads were any good, partly because they weren‚Äôt fresh - something that is supposed to be figurative of a salad ‚Äì ‚Äúfreshness‚Äù.

Starters : We had veg and non-veg soups, lots of breads - naan, roti, kulchas. Veg starters included paneer tikka, potatoes, veg mix fried. Non-veg included couple of chicken items and fish. They had little variety of but not so tasty starters.

Anyway, rushed towards main course ‚ÄòDal makhani‚Äù which was waste. Or in another word, I was searching for Dal Makhani flavor. And I feel, in this level of restaurant at least Dal Makhani should be right!

Moved ahead and tried vegetable dum biryani with Mutton curry. I must appreciate, mutton curry was yummy and cooked properly but in the same dum biryani could be better.

For desserts, it's a good mix of Indian (including Hyderabadi bestseller Double Ka Meetha) and European delicacies.

I am not much of a dessert being, but was glad to see a large number of desserts in the buffet.

Overall, I will not call it astonishing stuff, but it has wonderful musical spacious place with decent ambiance but they need to improve food side a lot.",1
"Waiter: Bahadur, very well spoken and serves fast.
Rahmath, Ripun - good job üëçüèªwe are very happy there's service also lovely pic again visit soon love abs ,,,,,,,,,,,",2
"We went on the new year day. Menu was limited. We waited 1 hour almost to get our food on the table. Service was horrible due to rush. Food was not that tasty. We ordered rajugari natu kodi pulao, which was bland. We ordered kothmira kodi kura as curry with roti. It was just OK but less spicy. We ordered junnu for desert which was the only good thing amongst all the dishes bit the quantity was so less for the price. Overall it's too much hyped restaurant with ordinary tatsing food at expensive rate. My suggestion better look for other options. Don't go during festive seasons it's crazy crowded.",0
"Been there for team lunch..I had expected a lil
More from this restaurant but it wasnt upto it.They had lil vareity of not so tasty starters..main course was better though..they had good vareity of sweets fr sure..overall it was good but can inprove over the taste!",1
Good food and ambiance one should definitely visit this place.especially service provided by them is awesome. Even nandan is cool guys.try egg pellets therw,2
"This is such a over rated stupid place. I really dont know why is this even liked by people.
Food was very bad, service too.
Menu is an ocean and taste is nill.
I dont think they will survive over time, quality has come down soo bad.",0
"Was here with the office team for buffet dinner and drinks and couldn't find much varieties on table. 4 points for taste, 4.5 for service and 2 points for their dismal amount of variety. You don't get much brand choice in drinks either.",1

experience this kind of service anywhere.. It is that good. Food made by Chef pankaj is excellent.",2

"An evening in THE Radisson itself is one it's kind. And when the food is unlimited, it's just bliss - a heaven on earth.

We had booked a table via Nearbuy and were eager to embraced the experience of the world class hospitality, variety of dishes and a great ambience. But somehow, we don't know all that excitement was dipped a bit when we started experiencing it. It is maybe because of our exaggeration or it wad just like that, we don't know.

When I retrospect back home, I thought that it was due to the inattentiveness of the staff there. Not that they were rude but they didn't care much. The manager was busy boasting the foreign customers who were dining beside us.

Well, coming to the dishes, we had a nice sumptuous dinner. The best part was the dessert section. If had a variety of spreads. It was as if the whole chocolates in the world were right in front of the eyes.
Oh, boy! I had a ball.

Had the staff had been a little attentive, I'd have rated an easy 4.0! I guess they neglected us because we bought vouchers from the Nearbuy. But we've been too many 5-star hotels earlier using the voucher but never were treated differently.

"Cascade is a spacious coffeeshop with an extensive menu. We tried the lamb burger, club sandwich and spaghetti in tomato sauce. Food was fine although the chef forgot to add bacon in club sandwich. Spaghetti was yum. There was slight delay in service although staff came and apologised later. There were good breads available for sale although noone really encouraged you to buy. Staff lacks initiative.",1
Good atmosphere to eat with relax.tastes good.quality is good.good serving and serving people.good experience every time when I go KFC..wings are my ever favorite from KFC.,2
"I had huge expectations on food based on the review but taste was not up to the mark. And staff is not customer friendly.
Not recommended to anyone",0
"Good ambiance with wide range food options , people having different taste of food can enjoy the place and good for team dinners
Happy dinning",1
Ordered zinger doubles and hot and crispy chicken....taste was good....packaging was very good( I really liked the KFC sticker on the outside which made me assured food is not tampered with)....delivery by Zomato also on time....just hoping KFC would consider to bring out more option in grilled or baked chicken items so that food can be healthy.,2
I ordered Raju Gari kodi palav from this pathetic senseless restaurant. Why the hell there is water in Raju Gari kodi palauo? It is full of water. I have to heat and boil it again to take water out and it became paste. Is this how you serve customers? Pathetic. I am never going to order again from this restaurant. Stupid restaurant,0
"We were there to celebrate our anniversary. There was a set menu, Welcome Drink(very refreshing) tomato Shorba(passable),crispy paneer, chicken tikka (both were very yummy) , butter chicken, paneer butter masala( both passable) , daal fry (yummy) roti (soft) and steamed rice.The pasta in white sauce was good.. But the absolute let down was the pan seared fish with tomatoes. The fish was not done properly, no crispy skin and was a bit smelly. There was ice-cream too.. The service was amazing and so was the ambiance.",1
I have ordered from here using the Zomato app. The ordering was simple. They responded very fast and I had the food delivered within 30 minutes of the order. This was a happy experience. The burgers were very good and the chicken legs still warm and succulent. The rice with small chicken nuggets was also excellent though the quantity seems to be a little less.,2
"Extremely disappointed with the food taste.we have ordered Kodi roast which was average when compared to godavari royyala vepudu.we usually expect dry item when it is named as vepudu but we got gravy and semi gravy items.same experience with two more items kakathiya mamsam vepudu biryani and Kodi vepudu biryani..
Even the prices are extremely high.if taste is better no one would be bothered about price.üòë",0
"Ambience: Peaceful place to hangout with a small group especially during late nights

Service: after two visits, I can say the service is consistent just like any other top hotels in the same league.

Food: Yes, I must say the burger is mediocre. I went for the tenderloin burger cooked medium. This patty has some herbs mixed in it, so if you like some rosemary and thyme in your patty, try it out.
For 850 rupees including taxes, I can say it‚Äôs on par with other offerings in the city with a different twist to their burger. 3.5 stars for their burger.",1
I frequently order frm kfc and every time i come up with happiness...I just love the chicken wings of kfc..food quality is so good..fresh rice bowlz spcly love the cookies biscuit..i never got delayed my order the delivery boys are trained...thank you so much for providing us such a good food..,2
"Heard so much about this restaurant and went to enjoy the weekend dinner, but the rotis were served cool and the curry is full of oil. Inspite of complaining to concerned staff, there wasn't much difference. Try to avoid Ulavacharu, if you want to have a tasty and healthy food.",0
"I have visited this place for team lunch.. We opted for lunch buffet.
High expectations but all waste.
Ambience - 5*
Food - 3 *
Buffet spread - 2.5*

Highly disappointed with the options available in buffet..
Hardly 7-8 options for both veg and non veg
Taste was also not exceptional.

If you want to visit this place then don't opt for buffet.. go for Al' cart.",1

Went for a dinner buffet for a family gathering and the food is just average for the price we pay.Most of the items are not available on the buffet menu which are served at the table but with lots of delay.,1
"I have been to this place and also ordered from zomato. Chicken stuff is best, chicken wings, fried chicken, chicken burger etc. Avoid stuff like rice bowls which aren't that good. Place is okay. Can be slightly crowded at times.",2
"No taste in food, starters were served cold, probably it was already cooked so waiter suggested us that dish. It is expensive and not worth at all. they are trying to be over authentic and spoiling the basic taste of food.

Rotis are very hard and Ulavacharu biryani is too much masala and no tasty.

Not suggested to visit.",0
Nice ambience but far too less items as options for food in the dinner buffet. Would suggest the management to improve the spread as we hardly get couple of options per cuisine in this multi-cuisine spread that hyatt offers,1
Yehh is good to have this KFC food and I like it.and I want to eat it every time because I love it a lotttt Soo friends go and eat itt and enjoy ittt,2

"Well, who doesn't love KFC. I mean, apart from their usual slips and mistakes, KFC had always been a tasty treat. I ordered the double zinger burger once and I loved it. I'm a big fan of the devil's wings. The super charger was awesome too.",2
The moment you enter the restaurant the ambience is good.We ordered Godavari royalla vepudu that was good.Then we ordered Gadwal kodi pulao was ok their sambar rice was so sour more of citrus taste that was not at all acceptable.,0
"Been here for a buffet lunch on weekdays. Spread was really limited and the food was not that great. Don't recommend to anybody else. These guys being a costly place, should have atleast taken care of their spread and taste.",1
"Ok I'm not a big fan of KFC but I kinda really like the zinger 5 in one meal. On the days when I really have no freaking clue what to have I straight away go to have this.
Go fill ur belly on these burgers!",2
"We went to the first floor confused whether to go to Shanghai Chef or Kobe's, later to realise they are in the same restaurant (i.e they share floor space). We decided to order Chinese. We had the DimSum platter (3/5), Kung Pao Chicken (2/5), Dragon Prawns (2/5) and Fried Ice Cream (4/5). The chicken was hard inside (not indicative of fresh chicken), the prawns were sweet and the DimSums had thick coatings. I did not enjoy my time at Shanghai Chef. So maybe when you're there, just try the Sizzler. Ill update my review when I have it.
Kobe's is a really famous chain for Sizzlers.",0
"I came here for a buffet.The overall experience was average.They have a huge spread to choose from only in the salads and when it comes down to starters and main course i was pretty disappointed because of pretty limited options i had to choose from even from which there was just a single starter that made me even think about seconds.The deserts were decent i loved the chocolate ice-cream.

Moving on to ambience the seating and the restaurant was pretty decent and i think the true look and feel could be experienced at its best if you were to visit the place for a dinner. The service was pretty swift.

The place , the ambience (specially the outdoor) was amazing... ... the service is good
the food though was ok..not that great....",1
good as always,2
Extremely poor food quality. I have got my food order replaced everytime I have come here. The service is also not friendly. This is my last visit to this place. I am sorry for the negative reviews.. but this time it was unbearable.,0
We had dinner at this place last night. The spread was quite lavish but we personally felt that non-vegetarian dishes were less when compared to the pricing of the buffet. The food was average as compared to the other Hyatt at Banjara Hills. The only thing I enjoyed was the fresh ravioli pasta they were serving. And also they had no soft drinks included in the buffet which is quite stingy. But the service is top notch and the staff always keeps a tap at your table and was eager to serve us which was great.,1
Took my friends brother for an early lunch meal on Sunday. Restaurant was pretty empty and we had a pretty good meal. Service was fabulous....the kid spilled his drink and they offered another one.,2

"Had lunch buffet today, but disappointed :( .

No choice of our food can't be ordered i mean other than mentioned in food menu :( .

Very less food options compared to others which have same brand level.

But ambiance is very good, it's a pleasant, peaceful.
Service is also very good they are very polite.",1
"One of the best chicken places ever. The ambience is good. A nice place to hang out with friends. The staff are good too. The menu is extensive and very delicious. Pocket friendly place for all the chicken lovers.
My personal fav is the zinger box which has a chicken zinger, hashbrown, 2 pieces of chicken and coke worth 200bucks",2
"I have ordered food online, Veg Chilly Garlic Noodles and Honey Chilly Potato. The taste was pathetic. In chilli garlic noodles, there was no garlic. And Honey potato noodles, they have made French fries and put a sweet syrup on it. Looks like chief does not know how to cook this dish.",0
"Positive:
1. Great place for a team outing. You get your space
2. Nice facilities
3. Buffet had a wide variety from North Indian to Asain to Street food

Negatives:
1. Not much choice for vegetarians
2. Too costly for its quality",1
"KFC has to be good. If not good its not KFC at all :p
Nobody cn resist those juicy chicken legs.
I love the popcorn chicken and smoky grills.",2
"Service was pathetic and staff was absolutely rude and not open for feedback. service is one area where management has to focus on at least as per my experience. Definitely not a place that I will ever visit again with the kind of experience, not that there was any argument or anything it was very cold.",0
Food is not bad but not like northeast. Service are very slow n staff will not response properly. I didn't understand its northeast food or korean food. I ask for northeast food n disappointed.,1
good food,2
"Restaurant serves stored food. Today I visited to have fried ice cream but it's not fresh. They prepared the food long back and just kept it refrigerated. It's not fresh. When I asked for any manager in the place, there is no Manager available. Worst experience ever. I would not prefer it to anyone.",0
"A little understaffed when I visited on a Friday evening, and while the food lived up to its usual great standards, I was kind of bummed out that all of their salads and their spinach and mushroom dumplings were unavailable. I have not been able to order a salad in the 4 or 5 times I have been here. Kudos to the team for their effort, nonetheless. I know it was a busy night for a small 2 person service team.",1
Order was very fresh!!!!! Very yummy..,2
A small place with with dim lighting and gives the feel of romantic dinner table. At first we thought it's a good budget friendly restaurant for Chinese food in gachibowli. Food tasted good and so was the presentation. we were enjoying our food and suddenly we heard people arguing with Waiter over something. And to our horror when we find out they had found cockroach in their food our experience turned into nightmare. They should maintance the hygiene of their kitchen.,0
The food was delicious but the service was hilarious I'm giving 3 star only bcz of the food we have to cll again and again more then 5 times after than finally. They come,1
Been there when me and my friend was so hungry after our shopping we ordered a smoky chicken rice bowl. We awaited almost for 35-40 minutes while our order was done it was too late since we were too hungry it was so disappointing. Coming to the smoky chicken there was nothing so tasty in that it was a normal piece cooked didn't felt it different. Coming to service it was self service but the seating area was good.,2
"Food was not that not at all good .. just not able to have the name that they have got ..
I have ordered 2 items and was thinking to have more but by seeing the tase and planes to shift other place .
I have ordered chicken fried rice and I see chicken was not that well cooked and I can see chicken skin been used as that same have complained to management and they told me they use skin less chicken and they this might be a miss and told will change the order and they have replace it and again I got the new one but I was again I was disappointed to see the same mistake ..",0
"Having heard a lot about this place and my curiosity to try a new cuisine that's a part of India, but different from the other usual cuisines, led me and a bunch of my friends to Zing's for dinner.

First up, we were greeted with a distinct smell of raw pork which was mildly unpleasant. The starters were quite good- spicy chicken momos and the pork preparations (pork belly and some kind of chilly fried pork).
The main course, however, was disappointing, or perhaps we expected something else. The Ramyum noodles tasted like a bland version of Top Ramen and the noodles had a strange texture to them. There was not enough broth either (which you tend to expect from any kind of ramen noodles). The Teriyaki chicken rice was a tad too sweet for my palette personally.

The best thing would be the prices- everything is so resonably priced, it's not easy to find non-veg (especially pork, beef etc) at these prices!

One major area of feedback would be the service. They have an extremely laidback, dont-really-care attitude, and it took a bit of effort for us to get their attention and get them to the table each time.

A little more effort from the management and they could be do loads better than they are currently- maybe even start a franchise :)

Value for money- 3.5/5
Service- 2.5
Ambience- 3/5
Overall- 3/5",1
excellent job,2
Worst chinese i have ever eaten !! The chopsuey was sweet and the paneer was bland !!!,0
"Been here with friends for lunch, the moment we entered in to the restaurant you will feel as if your in some eastern states. we ordered drumsticks, chicken teriyaki and OM chicken rice. The drumsticks were good with sauce and best part was chicken teriyaki it was delicious and tasty and the OM rice was okay. Overall food was good and service was okay.",1
"Nice store outlet of KFC.  Came here for a quick snacks - the usual reason why we all go to KFC's :)

I like Zinger burger a lot.  They now introduced a new krunchy Zinger burger (didn't try it as yet).
Their choices of krushers is good.  Tried the blue flavoured one.

Overall its a good store to come with friends and have quality KFC food.",2
"The Overall Rating present for this restaurant doesn't justice the experience (will come to this in a bit)

So, a small almost cute little place tucked in first floor with ambient lightings turned on (to give romantic dinner table feel) and apt audible english chartbusters couldn't go any wrong with setup and restaurant proudly own this.
With this as a beginning, shanghai chef takes the dinning experience to whole new diff level which is confusing at its best. Waiters are surely not in the mood to offer appropriate tables to guests, not aware of all the food which is getting prepared in kitchen, not aware of all the 'Must Try' dishes of their own menu & most of all courtesy seems to have been left at the mercy of the servers. Like an example, since its not a fine dining we can't expect servers to serve your food left in the bowl again but same server at one table doing the same thing neglecting other tables left too much to be desired. This was the case, when a cockroach was found in one of the guests food and staff tried to avoid the scene blaming it to fate.
On the food side, crispy corn was good but avoid maonchow soup. Flat noodles also served just warm that too after enquiring multiple times.Also, Service takes the beating even if just half tables are filled.

So, coming back to first line. The rating is probably for food only, go at your own risk if your are looking for experience !",0
"I read a lot of reviews about this place before visiting, most of them read that the service is very slow. I only realised it after I went there.
I was so tired waiting for my food that I only had starters here and went to some other place for dinner.
Food was no wonder very tasty.

We ordered drums of heaven and pork belly in chilly sauce. It all tasted really nice.

I hope the place works on their service.",1
v good,2
We found cockroach in the food!! Unhygienic pace! Dirty kitchen!! Horrible Staff and worst Manager! Please think twice before you order food from here,0
"The staff is a little less knowledgeable and understanding when it comes to explaining the dishes, they don't have anything for a vegetarian guest ( we had one vegetarian friend in a group of 10 who starved )

They restaurant smells for the raw meat from the kitchen.

The mocktails are good, the pork is mid rare and juicy, however the chicken is not that good.",1
gud,2
"Not a great place. It has ok ambience and good hospitality but the food isn't great. I've tried America chicken chopsuey, it's different from other chopsuey's out there and it's just average. I've tried the tei pei chicken starter and it was not great, the starter was not skinless and also the chicken was very chewy making it difficult to swallow. I've heard that momo's over here are good but I didn't want to try. Overall I wasn't satisfied.",0
"First of all they dint have main dish for which i went... Bibimbap and kimbap.. But still i got teteiyaki chicken and noodles. Sweet and simple place with pretty cozy ambience. People who serve food are very friendly but there were only 2 people who were serving food so our order came really late. Place is really famous so people were even waiting outside for seats.
Tip: please call them beforehand if you are specially looking for Bibimbap..",1
deliver is too fast.. good guy,2
We came here to enjoy some good Chinese food but instead were served with cockroach in American Chopsuey. We immediately showed that to the waiter and asked for the bill. They deduced that dish from the bill but again won't dare to go to that place again.. Was very disappointed..,0
"First things first:
Decent food. Average Service. Affordable pricing. Big on non vegetarian delicacies.

Small place with cute interiors serves up some mouth watering momos, bruschetta and Ramen.
Good things take time, especially if it‚Äôs a newbie kitchen trying to serve you food. Be patient. The service is slow but the food is good.

If you‚Äôre looking for a bowl of north Eastern style of Ramen, try their version of it. Simple, soupy and well spiced. It‚Äôs a bowl of comfort. Let‚Äôs not get your hopes high just yet. It‚Äôs their version of it and not an attempt to mimic the classic ramen that is usually popular otherwise.

The momos are good, soft and melt in the mouth- must try. They run out of the vegetarian ones rather soon.


Overall it‚Äôs a small place. Give it time, nurture it. Go for the experience.",1
good,2
"I have never rated a place one star before but this place dissapointed me to the core!
Ambience is pretty decent and so is the pricing, but the food is nowhere close to being authentic chinese ,oriental or any of the cuisines they are serving. Food was so spicy that we were sipping water after every bite and after few bites i had started tearing up. It was so spicy full of whole red chillies that it was impossible to eat it (P.S. we are a family who loves spicy food). Also in the name of dimsum for rupees 250 they served street style steamed veggie momos which cost barely 50 rupees a plate. Highly dissapointed with food!!",0
"Hard to get hold of their attention. After a number of visits I now have come to terms that, it  usually takes 10-15 mins for them to come tend to you. Heck even a glass of water takes time to come to the table. Service needs to get better ! 

Anyways coming to the food, a great place for most things pork. My favorite dish which is something I totally gorge over is the Bosam. Nicely sliced pieces of pork belly, kimchi and tender pices of chillies. Each bite is a bliss. The kimchi pork fried rice is good too though I wish they could improve upon the quantity of pork in the dish.",1
good,2
"This place has lost its charm
Went for dinner today. Ordered honey crispy chicken and butter garlic prawns.
They served honey crispy chicken was waiting for butter garlic prawns. After 40 minutes the person comes and asks for main course order. I asked for butter garlic prawns he comes back after 5 minutes and says it‚Äôs not available.
Pathetic service they take almost an hour to tell you if a order is available or not. Better avoid it if these are the standards of this place wasting customers time",0
"I was pretty excited looking at the 4.6 rating. But quite disappointed. I would rate the food at 4 though. But service is extremely poor. The staff isn't good at recommending dishes. The Beef curry with Naga chilli isn't good, probably because they had overused some condiment giving it a bitter taste. The pork belly was good. Beef fry wasn't great because meat was undercooked. The steam country chicken curry was good.

I would give this restaurant another chance and come back again because I really love the food from the north east and then order something which would be actually good and worth the rating it boasts right now.",1

Hi. This is a restraunt where even if the customer says the dish is bland and not tasty chef comes back and say it's the way that it gets cooked. No words more than that.,0
"Hello Guys, This will be honest review. We visited yesterday(7th Dec) as we heard a lot about this restaurant. We had a mixed experience here. When you enter this place, you will definitely feel a bad smell inside. That was really disgusting. We ordered Chicken lollipop, Smoked Pork, Bosam and Ramyun Noodles. Food was awesome except Bosam. We didn't like the taste. So If you want to try Northeast food, surely you can give a try.",1
Grilled chicken is not good,2
Ordered sesame chilly chicken for home delivery and it was one of the worst chicken dishes I have had. Chicken was like rubber and they had added so much spices that it was almost bitter. They didn't even have the sense to send a spoon or fork and some tissues.,0
"We were soo excited about the place but somehow not satisfied.. Firstly.. The place was in utter silence.. The ramyun noodles, bosam, butter garlic prawns were all just mediocre and purely serves just 1.. Lack of Salt was felt in some dishes.. Yea but the mock tails were good..",1
ok,2
ordered salt and pepper prawns : it was extrememly salty and we couldnt eat it,0
Stopped here to have a Americano and a Boston cream donut. The coffee was good but the donut üç© did have less or no filling at all. I‚Äôm not sure if all these places have the same procedures for hygiene coz I bit into something I did not want at all. The staff did apologise but it wasn‚Äôt a pleasant experience. The place did not look like it was taken care I expected dunkin had the same standards thru out the world.,1
"Even though I made the payment via paytm, delivery boy asked for money as KFC is asked him to collect the money. So, i forwarded the screen shots related to the payment, very disappointed.. this might be an app issue.. Hope this won't repeat again.",2
I ordered with them yesturday and got chicken in my veg pad thai!!! :( very disappointed with it as xhilli potato was really nice. I dont recommend anyway who is vegetarian as I couldn't even reach them on phone....,0
"Dunkin Donuts has always been a great donut place according to me. They serve excellent coffee and burgers as well. I particularly love the Naughty Lucy burger, which is an all time favourite.
This time I decided to try their new Grilled Chicken Monster Burger and I was a little disappointed. As a whole, the burger tasted fine but, why on earth did the chicken burger have a layer of hash browns? Such a bummer. üòê
However, the donut did uplift my mood in the end, brining the final rating to 3.5. Man does that 'Death by Chocolate' slay me everytime (pun intended üòÇ).",1
good,2
Ordered veg fried rice. Was so bland and tasteless for the price! It smelled weird too. I somehow felt street food would have been much better and cost effective,0
"I just came out of this outlet. The food is as per DD standards but the venue lacked basic hygiene and maintenance.

The tables were not cleaned on time and hence it had flies hovering around it. The wipe used for cleaning the table too was so dirty that it left a stench behind after the table was cleanes.

For payment too when I decided to pay through the mobile wallet, instead of the standard QR code or getting a request for the OTP, I was asked to pay the same to the store managers number as their system wasn't working.",1
Excellent,2
"I had high expectations of this restaurant but was dissapointed. I sometimes ponder to visit them again, because as per user reviews they are good.

The seating is well, the air conditioning is not. Its either chilly or completely stopped. You cant help it.

The servers are less and even being a small place, you have to shout to catch their attention.

The food. Oh God! I dont know what happened with the chef that day, but he had put spinach in all of my dishes and that too in huge quantities. They were wreaking havoc on the plate and we had to leave a dish totally for that matter.

So many wrongs, bounds me to visit them once again to see whether they are like this all the time or was I unfortunate to visit them on their bad day. They also need a experienced manager.

Just 5 mins from my house and been there hardly a few times because I did not quite soulfully enjoyed their donuts. The 'ugh' quotient is missing in the do-ugh-nuts here which makes me do-not do the Dunkin Donuts.,1

"The only good thing about this place was friendly staff.
Rest assured was average.
Not so crowded either
Chopsey tasted like honey. Not up to the mark
It was chinese . It had to be a little spicy but a dissapointment.
Soup and starters were okay.
Also they switched off the A.C even when it wasnt late. Need to improve.",0
"To satisfy my donut craving stopped at this place. Ordered some donuts and hazelnut iced coffee, I'd give a 5 for the donuts as they were delicious but the hazelnut iced coffee was bad, it was very diluted and tasted almost like flavored water.
I love their donuts but drinks should be made properly too, please look towards it.",1
delivery was fast and perfect :),2
I went to this place yesterday and we used zomato gold. The service was very disappointing. Restaurant was out of staff. Didn‚Äôt attend properly even when the place was not at all crowded. Food was also not upto the mark. Served after a long time.Heard alot about this place but..,0
"Landed up here on a Saturday night after shopping a couple of stuff. Following summaries my experience below-:

Ambiance- The ambiance is of a coffee shop and quite a typical one of Dunkin. The walls seemed somewhat empty as compared to the Dunkin outlets I have been to in Pune and Mumbai. Ample seating for say 30 people. 3.5/5

Service- You pay at the counter and he will hear your doughnuts and you take them yourself to your seat. It is an entirely self service type of mode. Nothing extraordinary. 3/5

Food- We tried the following two doughnuts-:

Kit kat doughnut- The doughnut was very fresh but the kit kat taste was okayish, not exactly of it. The chocolate factor was also less. The freshness and the typical dough taste gives this a 4/5.

Mango doughnut- Literally no taste of mango but again the yummy freshness dough taste which won my heart. Just for that 3/5.

Will I come here again? I like just one here which is Ugly Strawberry. Do try that if you like strawberries.",1

Extremely disappointing experience today as I have already ordered the same item earlier also and it used to be good before.",0
"The ambience was fine, the chairs were cozy. I liked the bengaluru start up coffee. Death by chocolate donut tasted like chocolate cake and rainbow pop has the right amount of frosting, and the donut itself was very soft. Potato wedges were horrible, the pieces were very big and two of them were not cooked properly!!!!",1

very high priced low quality food,0
"I went out for evening snacks. The place wasn't clean as it should be as tables were untidy even the floor.

I have ordered for a box of 6 assorted delight donuts and one signature burger. Both the donut as well as the burger was fabulous in taste. But, they were out of stocks for most of the thing.

"Nasi Goreng, Kung pao chicken & burnt garlic chicken were really spicy & over powered with chilly flakes! Looked & tasted like every second grains of rice had a chilli flake tagged to it! The saving grace was the Indonesian prawn curry with steamed rice. Really upset with tonight‚Äôs order.",0
"Well what can I say about this place.. it‚Äôs nice for killing time but, if u plan to have good food it‚Äôs. big no. Donuts are good, but the service here is pathetic. A better service and good coffee would make me go back. Till then it‚Äôs off the list.",1

The service is very bad and the reputation of such shops are going down because they're treating all the customers as those low class business meet holding people in Hyderabad.

1. Tough guy cappuccino
2. Mocha chip
3. Jamaican rum with almonds

P.S: Just try varieties of donuts or burgers. Don't go for beverages.",1

"KFC Kentucky fried chicken üêî.. Every one know this place then why to review.. I came here to have a quick meal and that to a new launch item.. Krunchy burger. As u can see lot of adds about this..

The store is quite neat and clean.. Might be the reason there r only two tables..

Staff is quite good ND cool order for 5in1 krunchy box hit wings were really nice.. Hash brown potato I did not liked it there was no taste actually.. For my palate.. Coming to üçî burger there are some crunches added to the burger which make to feel it's crisp but coming to the chicken which is in side burger is not crispy it's soft..

But over all its good.. Want to give 3.5 buts u don't have option. This box will fill ur stomach and pics is decent.. No heavy at all 209/- for one box included taxes

Keep going good guys.. See u again",2
We ordered sea food bamboo rice and it tasted worse... Rotten smell from the rice made me sick... Ordered Kung Pao chicken.. we asked for something spicy and they suggested Kung Pao chicken.. but it is sweet ! I never knew that something sweet is actually meant to be spicy at Shanghai Chef!! We also ordered black pepper chicken curry and manchow soup... These two were ok,0
"Ordered litti chokha seing good reviews. They sent 2 littis with chokha, two chutneys, onions and lemon. The littis were good enough however the chokha was bland..the only taste i was getting was of mustard. No freshmess of coriander, flavour of garlic, or onion taste. Both of the chutneys wrre tasting almost the same. The only dominating taste was of raw mustard which overpowered everything. The food lacked freshness.
They need to work on making fresh chokha with fresh flavours.",1
So far the best kadhi chawal I have had in Hyderabad. Veg thalis here are amazing. And paneer lababdar is just finger licking. You don't have to think twice to place an order from this place.,2
Teriyaki chicken quantity was very little. Kung pao vegetables have no veggies in it. Just full of sauce.,0
"Its an open space eating place famous for their litti chokha. Although they have a range of options to order.

Recommend this place if you want to try litti chokha. They serve it with chokha and 3 types of chutni.

The service is very slow so you need to be really active to ensure that your order is through.",1
Best north indian food in town. The flavours were very well seasoned and we were very much satisfied with the reasonable pricing as well. Ordered naans and combos and it was given in fair quantity in relation to the prices. Would love to go again.,2
"I had pretty ""authentic"" Chinese food here. Along with chilli sauce and chicken pieces in noodles, they served few insects as well. Staff is also quite cool and composed. Even after showing it to them, he just walked away with the bowl and didn't even bothered to say sorry. Respect!!",0
"Open air ambience.. Just beside road.. Live music..
Specialty - litti chokha.. With the best chutneys.

There is just something about the taste that brings that Delhite essence in the food.

"Litti choka/chicken litti choka is the dish which one should go for in this place. It drags me here every time and mesmerizes my taste buds. A plate of it will full ones stomach. Taste is quite good. Quantity is sufficient.
Have not tried other dishes, but would love to try them too.",1
Are you bored taking North Indian foods from South Indian restaurant? Then you must try the limited yet handcrafted North Indian cuisines in Norfest which is rapidly increasing its presence in the city. I strongly recommend to all the city dwellers to stop by through this unique chain at affordable price with premium quality service. Must try- Makki Di Roti and Sarson da saag. I still feel those mellowing taste of this dish.,2
"Not up to mark as per it‚Äôs brand name.


Food is just like ordinary tiffin centre‚Äôs

Need to improve and provide food really authentic of Udipi
Ambiance is really awkward no cleanliness even in Ac family section also",0
Litti Chokha* This is actually they're known for .. back in Patna they're serving on of the tasteist litti in town.. But if we really see for something mouth watering near me.. With a budget of 90 bucks .. I really don't recommend if you're not in search of *LITTI CHOKHA* They're good but They can be much better.. I hope you'll know after tasting it once. I don't really believe to spend 90 bucks for a litti Chokha when I'm hungry and have more options in this price..üòÅ,1
"Norfest!! Northern food feat!

Serves well to it‚Äôs name. The large menu catering to all needs of group and individual combos.

Great for deliveries, order it at home or at work ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Second time for this place but first time got it delivered! Had ordered paneer butter masala and mix veg..great quantity and quality...this place is amazing for north indian foood.

I ordered Egg Mushroom Fried Rice. The food was rather spicy and I think the quantity of vegetables in the Fried rice should be more. overall it was just okay. Would not prefer to order again the same one.,1

Paneer lababdar & daal makhni from this place is very good. I also tried aloo kulcha and it was also good though the chole served with kulcha need to be improved.",2

They food is tasty but they misplace a lot of orders. It's a small place and a good option to budget dinners. The way they pack the food is really exceptional.,1

The Malai Kofta gravy is more on the sweeter side...",2
Ordered tomato bath. restaurant gave upma... worst service . never order in this site again,0
"It's a shack located on the Kondapur-Gachibowli road, just beside Glocal Junction. The service was quite fast and prompt, but the food portion was less w.r.t the price. They serve only 2 small leg pieces for 120/- whereas you can get 4 pieces for 160/- at Siddique, where it tastes far better. The music system is great, with some heavy bass and a good playlist. There is an open seating, which can be a big problem during the rainy season !",1
Ordered Paneer Makhani from NorFest and I would mark it to be the finest Paneer Makhani that I've ever had.. the paneer was soft and the gravy was just so amazing. The dish was made to meet utmost perfection and I recommend it as well .,2
this particular item not properly cooked. taste also not good,0
"Momos was not good
do not know how to make. stuffing was of spring roll.",1
"In Simple lines ""Good Thing Comes In Small Packages"" . People who love a authentic north indian / Desi Type , this is the place to visit.  Remember this is a Eat Out in a Shopping mall not a restaurant.

Price are reasonable. They have kept there menu Simple, not like in restaurant having menu books where you struggle to order.  I tried both veg and non veg [ starters and main course ] , after having a bite i had to appreciate  ""it's good"".",2
Ordered for tomato bath but they have sent upma... Waste of time and money,0
not so good,1
Its my all time favourite.. mutton galuati kabab and paneer mirch wala are my favourite.. also one can taste shikanji/jaljeera here which is awesome..,2

Could have been better.
Chicken Tandoori was Fine. Soft. 6/10

Amritsari Kulcha and chole is MUST try at this restaurant. Located in happening place yet economical option which provides value for money. Portion size is really good and recommended to carefully order to avoid wastage,2
sambar is not good. ghee dosa doesn't have any taste of ghee.,0
"This open air restaurant situated right at the mouth of the Whitefield turning, has branded itself as a Chinese and North Indian restaurant, but the Chinese on offer was not good at all. The soup we ordered had a weird taste, and we did not dare to venture further into the chinese menu, the restaurant had to offer.
The Litti chokha on the other hand was pretty good. And, they even claim to serve the best litti chokha in town. Can‚Äôt say whether it‚Äôs the best or not, but they did get it right.",1
A really good meal at a reasonable price. The quantity was perfect. Not a lot and not too less. I ordered the paneer combo and shikanji . Norfest dhaba has probably one of the best packaging materials. Looking at the box itself I started feeling more hungry. The only part in the meal that disappointed me was the shikanji. It was not something that you could brag about.,2
they did not give me sambar.. unprofessional attitude,0
"We always prefer the combo. It was always excellent. Today we opted for multiple items takeaway.. Chinese items. There was no flavour in anything, neither there was any chicken!! The chicken majestic was only besan! No chicken! Four pieces in whole of chilli chicken wet.. Noodles and fried rice was so.. So.. The three rating was for the previous combos..",1

Their paneer combo is a must try, dal makhani was really good. Another thing we had was amritsari kulcha with chole - kulcha was good but chole can be made better. overall a must go to place for the northside taste.",2
Worst,0
I ordered biryani from this place. Biryani was very dry. Rice didn't have any taste. Without Salan it was not possible to eat the biryani. Major part of the rice was white without masala.,1
A must try place for north indian food lovers. The kebab items are highly recommended. The only problem is it is a part of a food court. The items are decently priced and very tasty.,2
I have ordered sambhar vada and idli and what I have received is sambhar idli and idli.. üòê Please be careful while delivering the orders! Thank you!,0
"Looking at the overall rating & the close promixity to our office, visited this place for lunch along with my team today. Looks like this place is mainly for IT people as most of it is occupied by 3 batches ( 12+). Nothing great to say about the interiors, ambiance it is decent enough. I am the odd man out in the group being the only vegetarian, but will put in words what my colleagues said about the non veg food.

Veg: Not that great, we ordered Panneer tikka & palak sheek kebab for starters, Sabzi Nawabi Handi & butter naan for mains. Panneer is rubbery & not soft indicating it is not fresh. Palak sheek kebab is kind of bland with no taste & not cooked properly. As suggested by the staff, we opted for Sabzi Nawabi Handi which is a bad decision as the taste is not that good. Service wise, they took lot of time in getting our order which is a let down as well.

Non veg: Sikendari Raan is a standout dish whereas the other Murg Musallam is bland with no taste/spiceness to it. Same is the case with Yakhni Shorba which tasted like hot gravy water.

Overall I would not suggest anyone to visit this place considering the inconsistency in the food they served along with bad service.",1
"Finally someone can make food which I could call North Indian. Amazing place to have a typical north Indian types brunch or dinner. Only con I would prefer if they did had a proper place too.

Definitely visiting again.",2
There are garlic peels in my garlic naan. Not just one but almost every where. Staff was least bothered in this concern. They don't remove garlic peels from naan,0

"Tried this place after a long time. The order was just a south indian thali, peas pulav, Mixed subzi chatpata and a Strawberry milkshake.
Arrived at the restaurant by 2.15 on a sunday afternoon. After a full 40 mins the first dish to be served was milkshake!! Will a restaurant serve side drink / dessert first, when the main course is yet to be served?

Service 1/5 - you will see waiters only while ordering the food, once the order is taken you wont even see them coming to your table even to serve water. You will see them standing in one corner of the restaurant, few walking in and out of the kitchen as if they are very busy. But no one will respond when you raise your hand/ or call for them. I literally had ti walk to them and ask for water.

Ambiance 1/5 -
Some kind of strange smell comes similar to the one you get in a dumped wet cloths
In short a worthless place.

Food quality and taste 1/5.
Coming to the quality of food - the peas pulav had just peas in them i hardly found rice!.
Very salty mixed subzi chatpata dish which just had onions and capsicum.
As mentioned before the food was served after 40 mins. The south indian thali had a sambar - it was a hot water in which dhal was washed and rasam was just hot water; when requested for a refill of bindi (it was the only dish that was nice), I was told that the dish got over unfortunately due to the time. I seriously wonder what took them 40 mins to serve, I have never had such a bad experience before in any restaurant of this level.

Value for money - 0.5/5

For these so called high quality dishes I had to pay around 900. In short i will not suggest this place at all.",0
"A newly opened Daawat restaurant on Kondapur road. We visited on Saturday evening without prior booking. The decor is elegant and spacious with comfortable sitting.

We ordered Mojito and Ginger peach mocktails along with Daawat khas veg kebab platter. Mocktails were good but little too sweet. Veg platter was good but nothing excellent. Paneer particularly wasn't so fresh. We directly went for Veg and Chicken dum Biryanis. Again, both were just ok and quality of rice was just ordinary.

Overall the ambience and service is good but food is just average and not so rich. You can visit this place for casual dining with friends and families.",1

Chilli chicken, fish, paneer were also of subtle taste. The lamb starter should have been more soft & in eatable consistency. Egg and chicken friedrice was not having any salt. Veg Thai Curry was ok to some extent. Diff types of chicken noodles were ordered which was of average taste. Schezwan veg fried rice was below average. Somehow not satisfied with the quality of food served or the flavours or the service.Disappointing for the price paid and the food we had.",1
Good taste and best place with special thalis. Complete punjabi taste with chaachh. One of the good punjabi taste in hyderabad. A must go at least once.,2
Ambience was good.But the service was toooo bad.No one will take care after you order the food.its really pathetic.we need to ask for food repeatedly ..After 45 min they brought one starter and for main course they took one hour of time.Never prefer this restaurant,0
"Great ambience, excellent customer service, good city view but below par food! We ordered Sushi, prawns, gyoza, ice creme for dessert. All food was average in taste. If you‚Äôre looking for good Asian restaurant, there‚Äôre better speciality restaurants which serves better Asian fare. However, if you want to dine at upscale restaurant with good customer service, this is the place for you. if you find yourself here, give their homemade ice creme a try!",1
"I am shocked and I ever had in my life food taste like this in th any common food court of India it was my 2nd visit in 2 days, M impressed by veg Galaouti kabab what a flavour , smoothness, textures, binding, combination of paratha , now I am a big fan of Norfest.. it's simply located in food court no necessary and unessary interior, simple and fresh, love the food.

We order something like jaljeera green ... 5*
Lassi salted 5*
Veg Galaouti 5* 6* 10* 100* I just love this
Non veg Galaouti 5*
Kheer 4* feel little thin...
Love the food keep it guys I wish you good luck.

Highly recommended for North food lover

"By far, one of the best restaurant for North Indian Cuisine. It is our go to outlet for ordering food. The Thalis are really fabulous(Both veg and non-veg) . The quantity is more than sufficient for one person and quality has been really consistent!
They also offer Lucknowi biryani which is is different from normal Hyderabadi biryani and the meat and rice is mixed well (A typical awadhi pulaao). Overall, a great restaurant to satisfy your North Indian taste buds!",2
"I found this place pathetic. Went yesterday, most of the dishes we ordered were not available. The excuse waiter gave was that one of the chefs is on leave. I wonder if business stops for them if one the chef is not available.
I read on zomato reviews that their thali is good. And restaurant's menu on zomato mentioned that thali is available in dinner as well, but on reaching restaurant I found out they are not serving thali in dinner now. I travelled 9km to visit this restaurant.

Food was pathetic as well. Tanduri roti that we ordered was made of maida. And the dishes were either too oily or just bad.

Overall this place is very bad and doesn't deserve a visit at all. There are plenty of restaurants all around Hyderabad which are much better than this for half the rate.

Avoid this restaurant at all cost !!!",0
I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS FROM THIS PLACE CUZ OF THEIR EXCEPTIONAL INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS BUT ALL OF IT WENT IN VAIN. BUT WOULD STILL RECOMMEND THEIR DIMSUMS AND A CASUAL NIGHT WITH FAMILLY,1
Best place for authentic drool-worthy north Indian food. Reasonably priced and great ambience. The Dal Makhani was definitely the best I have had in Hyderabad.,2
I visited the place yesterday for lunch with my family. This is usually a most loved place by all my family members and me for a casual dining. But yesterday it is a very bad experience we noticed the manger is changed. It took 20 minutes to find some one to take the order. Then it took him almost 30 minutes for the thali. I called the manager and asked why is it taking so long as we habe only asked a thali and lassi. Then he told us that some of the food got over so we are preparing it again so only it is taking so much time. But is was courtesy that he could have informed us that it is going to take time. After 40 minutes the food was served. But the lassi again took a very long time we cancelled the order and moved out.,0
"This place is good unless you look at the menu card. It's like drinking alcohol and having good food and finding out you paid extra which you could have saved if you would have gone to a similar place with much less to spend. 900 rs for a glass of wine ? Well not worth going twice specially if other places are serving the same wine for 400 a glass.
But if you're a first timer the you must visit just to remind yourself there are other places much more cheap than this.

DJ plays some really nice music.
And one advantage is that this place is opened till 2 am.",1
"Being a veggie... It gets difficult to find good vegetarian food, but every time i have food from this place, its really good. I wonder how they are able to maintain consistency both in terms of quality and quantity every single time.

Overall review: Best place for north indian food!",2
Have been a regular customer. But waa totally dissatisfied today. Had to wait for 10 mins even to be served water. They are very short staffed and the manager is just not polite. They need to really up their service. Will think to go back again.,0
Super expensive wala restaurant that you spend with black money!! Stay away if you are putting your own... view is also not that good.. interiors are stale,1
"Place is good. Taste is also good but not the best. kebabs were nice except the galawati kebab it was not as good as lucknow one. The portions were quite small.
Service is fast.",2
Quality and quantity is very less for Biryani combo.it is not worth of 150 rs.As a team we ordered 18 plates which is not sufficient.please look into it.,0
"Late night place. Open till 4am. Food was okayish. Nothing great about the place apart from the fact that it's open late night and serves booze.
Ambience: 3.5
Service: 5
Price: 3 very expensive (not worth it)
Taste: 3
Food quantity: 3

We ordered kung pao chicken, homemade icecream, beers and some rice.",1
"Lunch at Norfest, Gachibowli.
I'm a big fan of this place and love their combos.
Ordered their Veg. Galouti Kebab which comes with a paratha underneath and the mint chutney.
Was mast mast, would have loved it to be a little more well done though.

Then came the Veg. Combo - Had 2 butter rotis with Mixed Veg curry (Corn, carrot, Peas, capsicum, potato, Aloo, onion mix ) + basmati rice and daal makhani.
Absolutely loved the mixed Veg curry and roti combo and daal makhani was very makhan makhani üòÅ with very little daal, but tasty nonetheless üòä

Norfest is now operational in PVR Galleria, Punjagutta hence becomes more closer to my location üòä

Their Paratha combos are also a strong recommendation.

"Overrated restaurant with pathetic service and average food. Spent 2.5 hours just for starters and main course. Had 2 rounds of rotis before paneer sabzi arrived. After asking manager that we have ordered main course more than half hour back, he told that you have ordered only 5 mins back. After this episode also it came after half an hour more. Visit the place if you have free time and want Air condition. Nothing else you can expect.",0
"We went for a family dinner on 15th April. Being a 5 star restaurant some basic amenities were missing which you can easily get in any local drive in or a dhaba. Noone was there at the gate for the valet and we had to wait for almost 7-8 min, whereas in any other 5 star, a person opens the door for the lady and help with the a smooth entry. However we went inside and opted for a buffet. The food spread was very good however, few of them were cold(roast chkn and fish tikka). The fish tikka wasnt there for quite sometime and even after asking for refill it came very late and by that time we were approaching for the dessert. The most annoying thing was the on the table service. The table wasnt ready when we were seated. We had to ask for napkin, spoon, fork and even for a glass of water. Multiple times. The empty plates were not even cleared until we went to find the guy and then ask him to clean. The taste of the food was good though and thats the only reason for me giving a 3 star.",1
"best butter chicken. Very nice service and staff is really friendly.
Will definitely visit again.
Highly recommended for the people who are looking for north Indian food",2
One of the worst in and around gachibowli. I ordered two rice combo and sent one and collected money for two. Such a non sense guy. The mathura villas owner. Never believe in their words.,0
Mexican corn parantha was rubbish.,1
"Best butter chicken i have ever had‚ù§Ô∏è if u are looking for authentic north indian food in good price, this is the best place.. highly recommended.
service - 5/5
Food - 5/5
ambience - 4/5",2
"Extremely disappointed with the service. They delayed serving the food. The staff is very lethargic and don't seem to care. Save your time. Go elsewhere. By the by, the pepper curry was the worst. Don't try searching for this in menu for this dish. It isn't there. They added so much of pepper, it felt like some chef's spontaneous idea which messed up our palate. -_-",0
too spicy parathas ... though they were good but they can make it less spicier.. it would be better,1
"I never been there for dine-in ,but ordered many times the deluxe thali which was very good in quality as well as quantity.looking forward to go sometime there ,üòã",2
"Ours was not a good experience, poor hospitali
ty, slow service n bad temperament from the manager. Not likely to visit again.. disappointed !!! üòíüòí üòíüòí",0
stuffing not upto the mark,1
"Suggested by one my best friend, this place is on fire when it comes to taste North Indian Food! 

What we Ordered : Amritsari Kulcha with Chole, Veg Combo & Paneer Combo with a Sweet Lassi.

Must Say, the Dishes were so damn yummy! Being in Hyderabad, I was missing good Punjabi Food and so was this place came to the rescue. Superb Taste specially the Paneer Sabji & the Amritsari Buttery Kulcha! 

The Food Court is well ambient and had a great Time!

Must visit if one misses North Indian Food!",2
Staff is very reckless and they are least bother about the customer. We left without having lunch for keeping wait for more then 30 mins and the manager even not ask us to wait. He went inside to cancel the order,0
"I ordered Paneer Paratha combo expecting to get something really delicious but what I received did not meet my expectations. The paratha was abundantly stuffed but it's taste was not that good. Also, it was way too thick.",1
"What a place to eat! We were more than overwhelmed looking at the Quantity and awesome taste of authentic North India. Ordered Rajma Rice, Amritsari Kulccha with Chhole, Paneer, Daal Makhni, Tandoori Roti, and each and every bit of it was scrumptious. Though we couldn't find our friend, Pratik, there (owner of the place), we were well off enjoying our food rather than a chit chat :-D
Thanks for such a great offering!",2
Never order full meals online... At the end you will get disappointed with incorrect items.. From the given menu... Expected alot by seeings reviews.,0
"Ordered Gobi and sattoo paratha as lunch from here. This came with dahi , butter , pickle and chutney. Gobi paratha was soft and flavoured and sattoo paratha stuffing was too much and I dint like the taste much as I couldn't get the exact flavour of it. The packing of this was excellent which came in a box packing using aluminum foil covering for paratha and every other thing well settled in the box. Overall it was okay with the accompaniments and more than sufficient for one person.",1
Had the best dal makhani and butter chicken at this place in Hyderabad. Located in SLN terminus.. on 3rd floor.. Not a big place but they serve amazing punjabi food at reasonable prices.,2
"For some reasons unknown to me, I decided to try this place. The thali on the other zomato reviews seemed worth a try I thought.
I was told thali would take 15 min, and I waited. After 25 min of waiting, when I started asking around, they said thali isn't available right now and will take another 20 min minimum. I lost it. No shame, no options to offer what could be served quickly. Just a plain no. I walked up, they asked me to pay for a bottle of water (which I consumed) and left. The manager didn't even bother.
Went to Over the moon next door and had a great exp. Folkd there told me this outliet of MV is in bad shape and likely to close soon.
If you want to take a chance of really poor exp, maybe no food, maybe bad food...",0
sattu paratha was a bit spicy and they used sugar syrup in almond milk,1
Food is The USP. All i tasted there was great. But my favourite is the punjabi butter chicken with bone.. such aroma n taste( m salivating while writing even) the only thing is i feel it‚Äôs a little burn in the pocket.,2
"Very bed experience.. they have created problem in deduction for zomato gold multiple times.
Zomato should take action against this restaurant.",0
all chutney pickles got spilled.,1
"Food was delicious and the service of Rakesh , Rangadhar and Chinmoy was very good. After food, they served us with pan with no additional cost. That really delighted us.",2
"This restaurant has gone way below the acceptable quality levels. Had been a great place to go earlier but looks like they have started compromising in quality of food and service. Items on the menu aren‚Äôt available but offered what they had at that time. Rice was watery, none to care for your concern but were commenting on what was wrong and it was eatable. Will never come here again.",0
cheese chicken parotha ordered was not good thia time and didn't receive chicken shawarma parotha,1
"Amazing food. Probably the best North Indian food in Hyderabad. Loved the rajma chawal, kadi chawala and their Dal makhani.
Saviour for North Indians",2
"This place was a good veg eatery earlier, with options of good thali..but the experience which we had today completely my opinion.
Food was cold, service was very slow, dirty tables and wares and Ill maintained wash rooms. And on top of it misleadinƒ£ offer of 25% discount. I just had my last visit today.",0
"Mexican corn paratha is good but you can improve it to better.
Aloo paratha has dough more than aloo
Overall I can say it‚Äôs good experience.",1
"This has been on my list for a while now, but for some reason, hadn't been able to make it there until recently. Went in for Lunch with my colleagues. Was impressed by the level of activity at this place, serving huge nos of online orders from a rather small kitchen (housed in a food court).

We ordered Mutton Galouti Kebab, Veg Seekh Kebab, Paneer Kadhai, Butter chicken, Dal Tadka, Tandoori Rotis and Jeera Rice. The Mutton Kebab was delicious - the 'melt in the mouth and leave you wondering' kind - only possible improvement was that they could have made it a bit less salty - strictly nitpicking.

The veg seekh Kebab arrived slightly late and was not as good as the Mutton, but still held a good taste. The star for us was the Butter chicken. Slightly tangy, moderately spicy, slightly sweet, incredibly smooth and buttery, with huge pieces of chicken. I was bowled over..! So impressed was I, that the Paneer kadhai, which was actually more than decent and very tasty, failed to capture my attention..! The Dal and the rotis were good, but paled in comparison with the magic of that Butter chicken. The only less impressive dish among the lot was the Jeera rice, which was almost devoid of all flavours except salt - could have been better.

In all, a very good experience. I cant say Value for money, but the food was impressive in general. Worth more visits, any day..! Thanks.

Food: 4.5/5
Ambience: 4/5 (food court setup)
Service: 3.5/5
VFM: 3.5/5 (a tad expensive, but probably justified by the quality and taste of the food)",2
Very busy place. Rude waitress. Thalis are very nice here but don‚Äôt try any other varieties because they taste very bad. I had very bad experience. Only vegetarian food.,0
"I had ordered Manchow Soup. The taste was very nice. It felt like a great start . Crispy noodles in it added a great texture and taste to the Soup, chicken was cooked well, overall a very good subtle starter. The Chilli Chicken Dry was One of the best I've tasted,was kinda smoky, chicken was cooked very well. the prawns quality and taste were justtt totally ammazing,cooked to perfection. Only drawback was the price and quantity werent up to the mark. the Chilli Garlic Burnt Sauce tasted extremely weird. The chicken fried rice was not that great too . It had good aroma and aura but taste was average . The restaurant had good ambience. Overall it was good experience",1
"Good food, great service... Been coming here since years and the best thing is that it's always been stable with the food quality & service... Good place to hangout... Love it üòä",2
"Yesterday we have been to Mathura Vilas first time had ala kart, oh my God too much expensive and not worth of against quantity we ordered
Kaju masala which is 265 inclusive of all taxes, he just gave in very small bowl, and ordered butter naan which is again looting only like 70rs each butter naan inclusive of all taxes, and coming to cool drink it's like ditched 70rs inclusive of all taxes. They simply loot your purse and money,",0
"We have been here on weekend afternoon for lunch as we want to have a authentic Chinese. Nice ambience, less crowded & peaceful environment. Warmly welcomed by staff. Coming to food as we have kid with us, so the dishes we ordered were of less Spice. Ordered some Veg soup, couple of starters. I must say Veg soup was made to perfection, full marks. We didn't like starters; Honey potato was too much on sweeter side than it should be & Babycorn starter has no taste (No salt, No spice). But again Main course specially Egg fried rice was very nice & tasty (could have ordered a bit more spicy one; bcoz it was infromed to us when ordering about the spice level but we ignored, so no complaints). Over all good experience, but spicy levels are far less :)

Ambience - 4/5
Cleanliness - 5/5
Service - 5/5
Food (starters) - 2/5
Food (Main course) - 4/5

Tip: Do check for spicy levels before ordering!!",1
"Great place, awesome ambience and amazing North Indian food. The most go-to place to satisfy your North Indian taste buds! 10/10 value for money. Last but not the least, quick and prompt service.",2
"I have been my third time here.
The food is quite good here. But when it comes to service we need a lot of patience.i have experienced the same third time.we had to wait for quite long time for food and even the bill

Food - 3/5

Service-1/5

Need to improve in this factor",0
"Ordered Tom yum soup, prawns pepper chilli, fish crispy ginger. Very good soup, Don't understand why u have to use barter prawn ok taste however batter was thick. Fish crispy ginger chilli very disappointing taste less. For Main course ordered Mandarin fish and chicken fried rice, below average food. Over all ok ok place huge difference in taste when compare to banjara hills outlet.",1
"One of my favourite place to visit all the time, I feel like home there, best part of this place is self and easy going service which attracted me a lot. My fav dish there butter milk, gauloti kebab, mutton Rogan Josh. People are amazing there, every one must try.",2
"Firstly the seating tables and chairs interiors all are awesome but the foooooood when compared with its pricing did not meet the minimum standards I could it is worst the butter naan is charged at a rs 60 ? Huhh the worst naan I ever ate and service what a pity I should stand and call a person for service and totally this restaurant is worthless for the service and the pricing
The pricing is very premium and the taste ! What a road side small dabas are very far better than this",0
"Soups were excellent.
Satay was ok.
Chopsuey with white sauce was not great.
I would recommend it with schezwan sauce.
Ambience is just fine.",1
This place is awesome. I ate a kulcha here it was awesome making me happy. It was cheap and best. I give 5 plus stars. We ate for around 1200 but we didn't get to know that it was so cheap.,2
Average food. Have come across small amounts of mud in the food. They take a lot of time to serve food. The menu is also not that special given the name of the restaurant which belies it.,0
"Mediocre food .
Ordered wanton soup and chicken dimsum.
For a crazy dimsum lover , the dish was unappealing as the outer cover was thick , though the chicken portions were decent . The wanton soup was mediocre.
What bothered me was the service personnel hurried his way through the order and mentioned that only main course can be served. It was still 15 minutes for the closing time.
I just feel some personal touch would have been better.
Will explore some more dishes , before commenting further",1
"Best Punjabi food I have come across in Hyderabad so far.
Called for Non Veg Kebab combo ..

Kebab Pieces - proper leg pieces of chicken marinated in juices of masala served with coriander chutney is damn good.

Garlic Naan - garlic and stretchy soft naans was pretty good.

Dal Makhani - Had such a good dal makhani , creamy and flavoursome. It made my day.",2
"Ordered north Indian Thali, tastes bad, most of the curries are bad in taste, except one which is panneer. I had a feeling that chole curry was prepared yesterday and it smells & tasts bad. They served 2 sweets, semiya and kirayi. Only Semiya tastes good.",0
I have been to this place last Sunday. We ordered soup and some tofu dish. Soup was awesome but tofu wasn't good at all. I felt the price was little high according to the place.,1
"Would you like to feast on North Indian food in Hyderabad? Are you a foodie or die hard fan of butter chicken? Go or order from NorFest, I was deffinitely vow after having sambhar or idli for couple of days when I ordered from this place. Big fan of them, tried their all outlet and I must say good pricing with awesome taste (Without curry leaves :)))) in Hyderabad (No Offence to south indian  food).
Best part is that it will not hurt your wallet badly if you compare with Dhaba etd 1956 or other so called north indian restaurant.",2
"Very poor service. People are very slow, you have to wait for 15 minutes to get one item. The funny part is even for giving bill they take ages as if they are not interested in taking money as well. I will never recommend this place to anyone because of its poor service.",0
"Ordered Chicken mushroom tofu soup via swiggy. The dish was hot but the taste was okayish. Was expecting chunks of mushrooms, tofu and chicken. But most of it was shredded.

Overall it was good to taste in winter evening.",1
"Ordered the Punjabi Thali for lunch. It was amazing. The quantity is perfect and the food was really delicious.
The thali had 2 rotis, paneer butter masala, dal makhani, mix veg, mint chutney, raita, steamed rice, salad and a dessert.
The packing was really good and the rate is pocket friendly.
A must try.",2
I have been to this place for random dinner with friends and it was the most stupid decision.. The place is the perfect example of mismanagement. The food was also pathetic. We have ordered sambhar rice after a lot of disappointment thinking that atleast it will come on time and will be good in taste but I guess they were checking our patience and it took almost 20-25mins for us to get that. They were so slow even in providing bill and on top of that they have added service charge without even our notice. I have given two stars only because the manager / owner (not sure) was really very courteous and he has asked not to pay by acknowledging our complaints.,0
"Recently visited this place. Decor is simple yet nice. Ambiance is Okayish with some soothing background music, good to focus and enjoy your food. However food was average. We ordered a rice, a noodles and a chicken side dish and all were average.",1
"Description of this place says authentic Punjabi food, and their food corroborates this very well. we ordered their North Indian special thali a few days back. 
The packaging was good and spillproof and looked appetizing. 
It had 2 vegetable dishes, one paneer, and one dal, along with zeera rice and 2 butter naan. and green mint chutney and A sweet dessert to end the meal with. The quantity was more than sufficient for one person.  Each item was very tasty and Kheer as dessert was the best of all. 
It was decently priced and if combined with any offer of zomato its just great deal. 

Food - 4/5 
Packaging - 5/5 
Delivery - 4/5 

Overall a very good experience.",2
"Food - Too salty and I did not understand how can someone go wrong with something as easy as bisebella bath.
Even the Other items were very average and salty

Staff - with only twenty percent occupancy, the staff forgot the order. And in General the service is lousy

Ambience - its neat and satwik.

I would recommend to give this restaurant a pass. Its not worth the time and money.",0
"Hello, 

This place was bookmarked for a long time now so I wanted to pay it a visit. And finally the moment came when I was actually able to go there. I am a huge fan of Indo-Chinese cuisine and I honestly had a high hope from this place but all in all it was disappointment. 

I ordered chicken manchow soup which was good although the salt was on the higher side. Hakka noodles and fried rice has too much oil and there's no reason for that amount of oil to be there in the Chinese food. 

Wolly chicken and chicken chilli dry had extreme amount of garlic which weren't properly fried and rather than giving a good taste, it made the entire dish difficult to eat as the flavour was overpowering. 

All in all, the food wasn't enjoyable. 

Will I visit again? Probably not! I am sorry! 

Thanks!",1
That taste of mutton Galouti kabab oh my god!!! Soo yum it just melt down in you mouth I just loved and recommend others to try it with lassi . So happy we could get at least this dish in Hyderabad,2
Worst service food. Those who want blood pressure problem may visit. Every thing highly saalted. Don't go on name mathura it's local. Worst food worst service,0
"I have tried prawn pepper chili , Chinese pavilion special veg noodles ,fried rice and some other Chinese cuisines from here. The prawn was very good .So was the noodles . though It had a plenty of veggies it was overpriced. Last time I ordered fried rice which didn't taste good plus I found something in the food that made question their hygiene . Never going to visit place for that.",1
I ordered food online but I wish I went there so that I could‚Äôve had more dishes. The food was totally delicious and their packaging is worth the money. I had Lucknow Chicken Dum Pulao Boneless and it made my day. Quantity looks less but taste makes up for it and you‚Äôll end up having a full tummy. Hyderabadi Briyani is famous but I found this on equal par with it!,2
"Service - Extremely Poor 1*
Food - Average 2*
Ambience- Average 2*
Overall not a good experience. We ordered for North Indian thali, had to wait pretty long for it to come. Finally arrived, now to make it worse, If we ordered for some more they took 20 mins or more to get the item. They are so slow in serving, you will loose interest in your food. Welcome drink came after we finished having the starters, such is their promptness.",0
"Restaurant serving a Chinese cuisine on gachibowli mehdipatnam road. The food is not so great and doesn't have that authentic taste. The dishes they serve are different but fails to impress interms of presentation, taste and even price.
The ambiance is good and doesn't have anything which will make you feel wow. The restaurant is costly so look at the menu on zomato before you enter the restaurant. One of the dishes we took was totally burnt. The quantity of food is good compared to other restaurants.

"Have been to this place and also ordered from here. This place serves one of the best Awadhi and Punjabi dishes in Hyderabad. This is located in the food court of SLN Terminus mall. Loved their butter chicken which went really well with Tandoori Roti. Galouti kebab was awesome as well and went really well with the paratha served.

Ordered Lucknowi dum pulao veg as well as Chicken today. Portion size for both was a little on the lower side. The flavors and taste were awesome. As soon as the food was in the house we could smell Awadhi cooking. They serve Boondi Raita with the pulao, this is a welcome break from the onion - tomato Raita that usually comes with Biryani.

"What‚Äôs the point of taking Zomato Gold when there are so many restrictions on what is eligible. Look at the terms and conditions - they are so restrictive. The main speciality of the Mathura Vilas, ie Thali is not eligible for Zomato Gold. Coverage of Zomato Gold needs to drastically improve. No point in having Zomato Gold otherwise",0
"It's very over rated on Zomato. Went to check based on the rating and my love for Chinese Food.

Wonton soup was the best I had. Ambiance and Service was 4/5. Food is a no no with prices falling on higher side",1
"‚ö´Ô∏è This has to be my favourite Punjabi restaurant in Hyderabad!!! During my short trip in Hyderabad,I have tried food in many restaurants but this one was a scene stealer!! What I liked the most abt this place was the amazing food at such a reasonable price!!!
The taste was something that will crave you to have more and more even when you are full!!!
I visited this place with my friend without any proper planning.. our intention was to visit the pub in the same mall but we were too hungry and were not interested in eating in pub!! We wanted something heavy to get that energy to dance like crazy üíÉüíÉ
So, we ended up in this restaurant!! It is located at the food court and has open seating facility!!!
.
.
üî¥We ordered the Punjabi Special VegThali:
‚Çπ269/-
It was the most delicious Thali I ever had in life, just divine and out of the world ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
It comprises of the following:
‚ñ™Ô∏èKadai Paneer (4.5/5)
Paneer are usually always tasty in most of the restaurants but the gravy always lacks the taste!! I have the habit of just eating the paneer cubes and leaving the gravy!!! But, this one has the most tasty and delicious gravyüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èDum aloo (4/5)
This was the veg of the day, potatoes ü•î were peeled properly and were marinated nicely!!! Just like paneer, the gravy was something to lure for!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èDal Makhani (4.5/5)
A Punjabi Thali is definitely incomplete without a Dal Makhani!!! It is one of the most popular and loved dal in the northern part of the country!! The dal gets its taste and richness from the use of cream and butter in black lentils and red kidney beans!! It was super yummy and definitely the best dal makhani I ever had!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èBundi Raita (5/5)
This one stole my heart ‚ù£ I think words won‚Äôt do justice for its great taste!! I never had such a tasty raita ever in any restaurant and trust me I eat out a lot!!! I would have mind having 3 bowls of raita at one go coz it was this yummy!! The curd was fresh and the minimum spices used in it was adding the perfect flavour... A big thumbs up for this dish üëçüëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èRice (4/5)
The zeera basmati rice üçö was definitely of the best quality!! It was big in size and was cooked so well!! Each rice piece was looking like a gem on its own !!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èButter Tandoori Roti (4/5)
It was soft, buttery and definitely only made up of wheat üåæ without any hint of maida!!!

‚ñ™Ô∏èSalad (4.5/5)
Fresh cucumber ü•í, carrot ü•ï and onion with a pinch of lemon üçã is definitely makes the best salad in a Punjabi Thali üëçüëç

‚ñ™Ô∏èKheer (4/5)
The perfect way to end a meal is by having a sweet dish and what can be better than kheer!!! It was not overly sweet but the sugar was mixed in a way that will suit everyone!!!
.
.
‚ö´Ô∏è The service was quick and they did not made us wait for more than 15 mins!!! What I like most about the food was that the spices was added in a perfect way, just to make it tasty they have not turned it into super spicy!!!
The quantity is good for one person although even two person can share it!!! But, I will suggest not to share as it is so yummy and tasty, you will regret sharing even a single bite!!
Surely try this outlet and you will thank me later ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"Apparently on holidays,half their staff too goes on a holiday.
The service was horrible, took them 10 minutes to clean our table and another 10 minutes to serve us water.
If this wasn't frustrating enough, they took 30 minutes more to get us undercooked food and some of the dishes in the thali were cold.",0
"The food was just average. Staffs were very nice. Serving time was also nice. The taste of food can be betternwith beyyer cooks. Comparing the price to the taste..... Its not at all worth.

Considering the area, I believe no one is serving better than them.",1
"a must visit for great North Indian food, relish on the veg n non veg starter platter, much delicious dal makhni n paneer curries n value for money is cherry on the cake, totally recommended",2
Pathetic place! We had ordered for non spicy food but what they served us was tasteless spicy food. Also when we wanted to order for dessert they said everything in the dessert menu got over by lunch and hence there is nothing left for dinner.,0
Had a mixed experience... Cant say it is bad cant say it is good... It is ok. We ordered soups and they are fine... Later on mixed sea food... Prawn is ok and squid is very smelly... Another chicken starter it is good. Coming to main course... Ordered crispy noodles and it is ok and then korean noodles also ok... Veg noodles is good. I recommend to try it once.,1
Awesome North Indian punjabi food served here at reasonable price,2
"Went there @ around 10:45pm, was really hungry.
Had heard a lot about this place.

Food was not good at all, roti‚Äôs (tandoori) could easily be confused with papad, both were so thin and cold.

Sabzi was cold and seems like they didn‚Äôt care about customer.

Even at that time when we were the only table operating there was so much delay for someone to attend our table.

"Madhumathi Mahajan Well to start with nice courteous servers and staff. Excellent serving time, all items arrived on time infact for a change had folks asking if we want to hold a little while before getting next dish out? These things matter a lot when u r paying to eat out.

Now food - Jade chicken soup, nice spinach based creamy stuff, gud way to start the meal. Accompanied by house salad of cabbage and cucumber kimchi, nice dressing but cabbage cut could have been good. Fish cakes were good, loved it and accompanying sauces were awesome. Main course was Mix XO rice of chicken and prawn, well that was the downer. Nothing exciting abt it, maybe shld have coupled with a curry but then Nash, fried rice u shld be able to enjoy dry. Desert - blue berry cheesecake, so here is where me and wifey differ, I thght it was worth it, she says the base wasn't crunchy engh. So try and rate yourself.

Last ambience - was warm n eye soothing.

Oh and I forgot, the orange pekoe tea, the best I had in lat few months. Have it",1
"Authentic punjabi khana in the Gachibowli area. Their rajma chawal , dhaba chicken and thalis are very good. Their Pudina paratha and Amritsari kulcha are very yummy. Dal makhani is very heavy. The kheer is a must try in the deserts. The seating is limited as it‚Äôs in food court but service is fast. Even home delivery packing is very good.",2
